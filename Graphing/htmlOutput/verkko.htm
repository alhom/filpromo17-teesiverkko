Estimates of future climate conditions are commonly based on output of climate models, which have several potential purposes of use in climate change adaptation problems. In this study, data from state-of-the-art global and regional climate models were analysed, together with their relevance for applications. Impact-specific aspects of projected future climate data were analysed in two studies, the first of which focused on Finnish crop production and the second on European road network. The other three studies had a more general focus and a global domain. In these papers, projected future changes in daily temperature variability and time-dependent development of uncertainty in climate model projections were studied.   A more general viewpoint was to assess the effect of climate model development on the climate projections. More sophisticated and complex models imply more complex interactions within and between the model components. As a result, model spread in the 21st century climate change projections has increased on all time scales. Neither the extent of the reducible uncertainty, nor the means to reduce it, are known. Uncertainty in climate model projections varies with the variable, spatial scale and the statistics of interest. The effect of climate model development for annual mean climate projections is unsystematic and model-dependent, which causes multi-model mean climate projections to be mostly statistically indistinguishable between three climate model generations. Conventional analysis methods used for multi-model ensembles do not fully exploit the superior process-understanding which is present in the improved climate models.   The utility of climate models varies with the specific adaptation problem and also other information sources are often needed. For crop production in Finland, changes in water availability in the future climate are important, whereas the expected changes in climatic factors only have a secondary importance compared to process understanding when estimating future conditions of European road network. Still, the prevailing uncertainty in climate model simulations should not prevent adaptation decisions from being made, as uncertainty estimates are expected to remain comparable despite model improvement." nohref="" />

Eukaryotic cells contain membrane-bound organelles to carry out specialized cellular functions. These organelles are inherited in cell division as templates and are augmented by proliferation through production of protein and lipid components by the cell, and the trafficking of these components within the cell. Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved degradation pathway for cells to maintain homeostasis, produce nutrients for energy production, degrade misfolded proteins or damaged whole organelles, and fight against intruding pathogens. The process of autophagy entails the isolation of cargo by a specialized organelle, called the phagophore, which closes to form a sealed double membrane bound autophagosome. This organelle then undergoes maturation by fusion with endosomes and lysosomes to obtain its degradation capacity. Hence, there are many dynamic membrane modifications that need to take place during the autophagic process. The origin of the autophagic limiting membrane, as well as the clearance of the degradative structures, are yet to be defined.    This study utilized high resolution electron microscopic methods and three dimensional modeling to reveal nanometer scale interactions of phagophores and autophagosomes with other organelles. Immunolabeling techniques at both light and electron microscopy level were utilized to determine which organelles should be sampled at an ultrastructural level. Direct membrane communication was detected between the phagophore and endoplasmic reticulum (ER), (putative) ER exit sites, mitochondria, the Golgi complex, as well as late endosomes or lysosomes. ER was the most frequent proximal organelle to phagophores and autophagosomes and this suggests an involvement of ER in the nucleation process of phagophores.    This study also reveales a role of the small GTP-binding protein RAB24 in the clearance of autophagic structures in cells. Biochemical and microscopic methods in combination showed that RAB24 is needed in the clearance of autophagic structures in nutrient rich conditions i.e. during basal autophagy. RAB24 was confirmed to localize in both of the autophagosome limiting membranes. GTP binding and prenylation of RAB24 were found to be necessary for the targeting of the protein to LC3 positive autophagic structures, whereas tyrosine phosphorylation was less important for this targeting. Electron microscopy revealed that autolysosome-like structures accumulate in cells when RAB24 is silenced, suggesting that it has a role in the clearance of autolysosomes." nohref="" />

Understanding the light scattering properties of Solar System bodies is important, especially in the case of the small bodies. For these objects, most of our data is photometric, i.e. measurements of the brightness of light in broad spectral bands in visible and near-infrared. Though limited in many ways, these data can be used to derive physical properties that provide constraints on the structure and material composition of the objects. These atmosphereless bodies are almost always covered with a blanket of loose material called the regolith. The planetary regoliths consist of a range of grain sizes from micrometres to tens of metres, and have a complex geological history and chemical composition.   We study two models for the reflectance of planetary surfaces. One is the Lommel-Seeliger model, which is mathematically simple, but also not truly applicable to particulate media such as regoliths. However, an analytical form exists for the integrated brightness of an ellipsoid with the Lommel-Seeliger scattering model. Ellipsoids are useful as crude shape models for asteroids. Some applications of Lommel-Seeliger ellipsoids are studied in the development of a faster software for the inversion of rotational state and rough shape from sparse asteroid lightcurves.   The other scattering model is a semi-numerical one, developed to model the reflectance of dark particulate surfaces, such as the lunar regolith and the surfaces of many asteroids. The model term representing the shadowing effects in the medium is computed numerically, and is computationally expensive to produce, but after being computed once, it can be saved and reused. The model is applied to disk-resolved photometry of the lunar surface, as well as laboratory measurements of a dark volcanic sand. The lunar surface is the best known extraterrestrial material, while volcanic sands can be used as analogues for basaltic regoliths such as the lunar mare surfaces.   These studies are still early steps in both of the model applications mentioned above. The results show promising avenues for further research. In the case of the Lommel-Seeliger ellipsoids, a statistical inversion scheme is used to gain information on the spin and shape of sparsely observed asteroids. In the studies with the PM scattering model, it was found to provide good fits to data, and though the interpretation of the model parameters is not clear, they are qualitatively reasonable. Some limitations of the current implementation of the model were found, with clear lines of future improvement. On the whole the model has potential for many applications in disk-resolved photometry of regolith surfaces." nohref="" />

The onset of schizophrenia before the age of 18 is commonly categorized as early onset schizophrenia. It accounts for less than 4% of all cases of schizophrenia, the prevalence of which is about 1% worldwide. Premorbid abnormalities seem to be very typical, and prognosis is often poor. Besides the negative and positive symptoms, severe neurocognitive deficits also occur.   Schizophrenia and pervasive developmental disorders share a common history. From 1970 onwards these disorders have been regarded as separate conditions. These disorders have different ages of onset as well as developmental courses. Nevertheless, the clinical symptoms as well as the results of genetic and neuroimaging studies overlap.   The participants in this thesis were adolescent schizophrenia patients (n = 18; 7 males, 11 females). The mean age of the participants at recruitment was 15.6 years (studies I-III) and at the time of psychological assessment 16.2 years (study IV). Study IV also included 15 adolescents with PDD without psychotic disorder (n = 15; 7 males, 8 females). Their mean age at recruitment was 16.1 years. All participants had a primary IQ over 70.   Study I of this thesis assessed the possible comorbidity of early onset schizophrenia and pervasive developmental disorders. We found that a total of 44% of adolescents with schizophrenia had some pervasive developmental disorder already in childhood. However, most of the adolescents had a correct comorbid diagnosis until the onset of psychotic symptoms and the diagnosis of schizophrenia.   Study II evaluated the number and nature of catatonic features among adolescents with schizophrenia. A further comparison was made of the nature and numbers of those features between adolescents suffering from schizophrenia alone and those schizophrenia patients with comorbid pervasive developmental disorder. All adolescents with schizophrenia presented many lifetime catatonic features. Adolescents with schizophrenia and comorbid pervasive developmental disorder had an earlier onset of catatonic features, more catatonic features and a greater variety of catatonic features compared to schizophrenia patients without comorbidity.   Study III aimed to assess the developmental skills of adolescents with schizophrenia. All of the adolescents with schizophrenia exhibited some developmental delays. Adolescents with schizophrenia and comorbid pervasive developmental disorders exhibited more delays in developmental skills than did those schizophrenia adolescents without comorbidity.   Study IV investigated neurocognition and social cognition between adolescents suffering from schizophrenia alone, those schizophrenia patients with comorbid pervasive developmental disorder and adolescents with pervasive developmental disorder only. The profiles of the neurocognitive abilities and disabilities between these three groups differed. The adolescents with schizophrenia and comorbid pervasive developmental disorder did not have more severe problems than the other two groups. The comorbid group displayed a combination of the visual strengths those are typical for PDDs and the deficits in processing speed associated with schizophrenia.   These study findings showed that among adolescents with early onset schizophrenia is a subgroup of adolescents with comorbid pervasive developmental disorder. The symptoms of these adolescents seem to be more severe, and this subgroup should be taken into account in psychiatric services and rehabilitation." nohref="" />

137
Japanese literature in English translation has a history of 165 years, but before the end of World War II no publisher outside Japan had put out a sustained series of novel-length translations. The New York house of Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. published 34 English translations of Japanese literature between 1955 and 1977. This program was carried out under the leadership of Harold Strauss, who endeavored to bring modern writers of Japan to the stage of world literature. Strauss and most of the translators were trained in American military language schools.   The aim of this dissertation is to study the publisher's policies and publishing criteria in the selection of texts, the actors involved in the mediation process and the preparation of the texts for market, the reception of the texts and their impact on the profile of Japanese literature. The theoretical backdrop is built around the distinction of product, process and function, viewed through the sociology of translation. This includes Pierre Bourdieu s constructs of habitus and capital and the Actor-Network Theory, as well as Karen Thornber s concept of literary contact nebulae in settings of less steeply inclined hierarchical relations.   An examination of Japanese to English translations investigates the trends and practices which developed after the forced opening of Japan, drawing upon materials from the Knopf archives, including correspondence between the authors, the editor and the translators. Personal interviews and correspondence with the translators, autobiographies, and memoirs add to the archival records. Peritextual and epitextual data help trace events and actions within this period of Japanese literature in English translation and assist with the investigation into the reception and legacy of the texts.   Findings clarify the policies and criteria employed at a major publishing firm. The role of the editor is explored in perhaps more detail than in earlier reports. Bourdieu's concepts of habitus and capital complement the notion of following the actors in Actor-Network Theory. Materials obtained from a translator and interviews with others add a qualitative perspective supported by the idea of literary contact nebulae.   The Knopf translations have a wider circulation in Japan than in the English-language markets. Further, a number of the publications have proven more profitable in European languages. The long tail sales have kept the translations in print and in classrooms to this day. These findings point to new areas of investigation. Knopf was the most active publisher in a period where English translations were published for the general reader. The translations were later inscribed as text and research materials in the growing university curricula of the then-nascent fields of Japanese studies and comparative literature.   Keywords: Japanese literature in English translation, habitus, capital, Actor-Network Theory, transculturation, translation history" nohref="" />

von Kügelgen, Maria

136
A significant number of people have problems with the batteries of their mobile devices. There are several energy saving applications available to tackle those problems. Most of them increase battery life mostly by automatically closing applications or operations. The user is for the most part unaware of what the energy saving application actually does. Therefore, even though the battery might last somewhat longer, the user may continue using behavioral patterns that drain the battery.  There is little evidence to support the assumption that battery awareness applications lead to behavioral changes. Therefore, we decided to conduct a research on how a mobile awareness application called Carat is used, and how the behavior of its users changes over time.  The study was carried out in two phases. In the first part of the study, we conducted a user survey, and studied the Carat log data of the devices represented in the survey. We found out that the behavior changes over time; there were significant differences between new Carat users, and the more experienced ones. The more experienced users had reduced their use of problematic applications more, were interested in different features of Carat, and opened it less often.  In the second part of the study, we studied how new Carat users used Carat and what they thought of using it. They were interviewed twice, and they also wrote in a web diary about their experiences. We found out that the main difference in their thinking was the increase in overall awareness about applications as something that affects battery life. We also found out that inadequate, uninteresting and unclear information causes confusion and frustration, and decreases the likelihood of users sticking with Carat." nohref="" />

135
The dissertation consists of four articles published in peer-reviewed linguistic journals and an introduction. The aim of the study is to provide a description of the formal means of expressing semantic transitivity in the Eastern dialects of the Mansi language (EM), as well as of the variation between the different means. The study is connected to Uralic studies and functional-linguistic typology.   Mansi is a Uralic language spoken in Western Siberia. Unfortunately, its Eastern dialects died out some decades ago, but there are still approximately 2700 speakers of Northern Mansi. Because it is no longer possible to access any live data on EM, the study is based on written folkloric materials gathered by Artturi Kannisto about 100 years ago. From the typological point of view, Mansi is an agglutinative language with many inflectional and derivational suffixes.   The study is based on information structural analysis, particularly the terminology and definitions proposed by Lambrecht (1994). The approach is based on three main pragmatic functions, primary topic, secondary topic and focus, and on how they correlate with syntactic functions and how their morphological markedness or unmarkedness is due to information structural factors. Further, the notion of topicality is connected to the concept of Differential Object Marking (DOM) and the observations of Iemmolo (2010/2011). According to the data of this study, DOM is based on topicality in EM. Finally, the analysis is expanded to include variation between the active voice and the passive voice and variation in three-participant constructions.   The topic of the study can be divided into three different sub-topics: 1) marking of the DO, 2) variation in three-participant constructions and 3) variation between the active voice and the passive voice. The main result of the study is a complex description of how the whole system of expressing semantic transitivity in EM is based on the same principles. Among others, the results of the study also show some new aspects that differ from the recent studies: for example, possessive marked direct objects do not always trigger the objective verb conjugation." nohref="" />

Valkonen, Elina
matlu:  Matemaattis-luonnontieteellinen tiedekunta, Fysiikan laitos
134
Extratropical cyclones can have major impacts on our daily lives, and therefore any drastic changes in their frequency or characteristics, such as intensity or radius, can have a great impact on society. Extratropical cyclones do not only affect everyday weather, but can cause extreme weather events from floods to drought and are also largely in charge of the equator-to-pole energy, momentum and moisture transports. In the recent years, there has been an increasing amount of both numerical and observational studies to suggest a poleward shift of the storm tracks with the warming climate. This shift could have major impacts all around the world through weather extremes and climatic effects. Even though a vast amount of research has been done, a definite answer, as to how will the location of the storm track change in the near future, remains unanswered. This study aims to answer the question of how has the location of the North Atlantic storm track changed with the changing surface temperatures, with the focus on the effects of the sea surface temperatures. In this study the CFSR (Climate Forecast System Reanalysis) reanalysis products from 1979-2014 was analysed. The cyclones were tracked based on the Laplacian of the surface pressure using the Melbourne University Cyclone Tracking Algorithm. First the differences between 1979-1988 and 2005-2014 for both surface temperature and extratropical cyclone track density, a measure of the storm track, were calculated and after that the correlation between ST and both track density and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index were calculated for the whole study period, 1979-2014. All the above mentioned calculations were done separately for four seasons (DJF, MAM, JJA, SON) and also for two six month periods (Oct-Feb, Mar-Sep). The results show that the North Atlantic has warmed significantly, with the strongest warming taking place in the Arctic in winter. There were also clear changes in the cyclone frequecy, but these changes were not as spatially coherent as the changes in the surface temperature. In fall season a poleward shift of the storm track with time was observed. In general, the results incline that in winter the increasing STs would lead to more cyclones, whereas in summer the increasing STs would be related to fewer cyclones. The results also showed that changes in the ST gradient over the sea-ice margin region between Greenland and Svalbard, correlate positively with the track density. This was suggested to be due to changes in the low-level baroclinicity. The NAO was observed to correlate positively with the track density around Greenland and the Arctic Ocean, and negatively over Eurasia. The most clear observation was the seasonality of both relationships. Between ST and track density this seasonality was more spatially incoherent, and most likely depended on multiple mechanisms depending on location. The seasonality in the correlation between NAO and track density, on the other hand, was not as strong as between ST and track density, but was clearly more spatially coherent. A strong southeast-northwest shift in the influence area of the NAO from winter to summer was detected, and this was noticed to affect the ST track density correlations in Canada." nohref="" />

Vainikainen, Mari-Pauliina
kasvatustieteellinen: University of Helsinki, Faculty of Behavioural Sciences, Department of Teacher Education, Centre for Educational Assessment
133
During the last decade, Finnish pupils  performance in educational assessment studies has steadily declined. At the same time the differences between pupils   and in the capital area also the differences between schools   have increased, and girls usually outperform boys in most assessed domains. The aim of the present study was to examine how these differences develop during primary education, with a special emphasis on the development of the performance of pupils in need of support for their studies. This was done by following three different samples of primary school pupils in two municipalities: In Helsinki a sample of 608 pupils was followed from the beginning of the first grade to the end of the sixth grade, and in Vantaa two full cohorts (N"H2000 in each) were assessed in the first/third grade and again in the third/sixth grade. In the beginning of the first grade the pupils took a learning preparedness test, and teachers evaluated their initial reading skills. At the turn of the third and fourth grade the pupils completed the Finnish learning to learn scales, which addressed a wide scope of cognitive competences and learning-related attitudes. Learning to learn assessments were repeated at the end of the sixth grade before the transfer to lower secondary education. Additional information was collected about pupils  social relationships, task interest and effort as measured by time investment, based on the log files of computer-based assessment. Multiple-group structural equation modelling, repeated measures general linear modelling and variance components modelling were applied in four substudies for testing the hypotheses about the influences of prior cognitive competences, attitudes, interest and effort on performance and about the different trajectories of their development within municipalities, schools, classes and peer groups.   The results showed that whereas girls were evaluated by their teachers as being slightly better readers already when they came to school, there was no gender difference in pupils  performance in the learning preparedness test. Girls, however, gained slightly more in reading comprehension during the first three years of basic education. Boys in Helsinki outperformed girls in mathematical thinking in the beginning of third grade, but girls closed the gap by the end of the sixth grade. Mothers  lower education and pupils  support needs were related to lower initial competences, but the differences did not increase during the first three years of basic education. In contrast, in regard to reasoning skills pupils with support needs even closed the gap to some extent. The gap between pupils with support needs and others, however, increased from the beginning of the fourth grade to the end of the sixth grade in both municipalities. Between-school differences slightly increased during the six years of follow-up in Helsinki, but in Vantaa the variation remained between classes in schools. From the end of the third grade to the end of the sixth grade girls improved their performance slightly more than boys in both municipalities. The log data analyses of the computer-based assessment in Vantaa revealed that girls  advantage could be completely explained by their more positive attitudes and greater effort as measured by their time investment in the tasks. Reduced time investment and higher levels of detrimental attitudes also provided a partial explanation as to why pupils with identified support needs did not reach their expected level of performance in the sixth grade assessment.   As expected, learning-related attitudes declined with age, but this change was unrelated with the changes in performance. Changes in task interest, however, were a meaningful predictor of later performance. Changes in attitudes and interest happened to some extent in classes and peer groups, and boys   who were also identified as having support needs more often than girls   seemed to be more vulnerable to the influences of their boy classmates both regarding their attitudes and task behaviour in the assessment situation." nohref="" />

Väänänen, Riikka
matlu: University of Helsinki, Faculty of Science, Department of Physics, Division of atmospheric sciences
132
Atmospheric aerosols have an impact on the global radiation budget, and thus on climate, they reduce the air quality and visibility, and have multiple harmful health effects. The climatic significance of aerosols result from their ability to scatter and absorb solar radiation, and, if being large enough, mediate the cloud albedo and lifetime by acting as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). The climatic effect, however, has a notable uncertainty.   Particles can be either directly emitted to atmosphere or they can form there from precursor vapors. The latter is called new particle formation (NPF). Globally, NPF has been estimated to be responsible for even half of CCN sized tropospheric particles. The understanding of the NPF mechanisms and the spatial and temporal variation of NPF in many scales is necessary to correctly represent aerosols in climate models.   In this work, we quantified the importance of biogenic organic vapours and anthropogenic sulfuric emissions in the NPF in northern boreal environment. Aerosol number size distribution data from three measurement sites were used to calculate the average continuous increase in aerosol particle diameter and number concentration when air masses travelled over land. A 14-year-long time series of aerosol and gas measurements were used to determine the effect of reduced Kola Peninsula SO2 emissions on aerosol population at Eastern Finnish Lapland.   Secondly, this thesis describes in-situ aerosol measurements conducted with a light aircraft within the lowest 4 km of the troposphere. The data were used to determine the vertical and horizontal extent and variability of the NPF events in the surroundings of the Hyytiala SMEAR II station. The airborne and ground level measurements were compared to find out the representativeness of the on ground measurements in the lowest parts of the atmosphere, in the planetary boundary layer.   The results showed that the Aitken mode particles grew, on average, at the apparent rate of around 1 nm h"1 when they travelled over the northern boreal environment during the growing season. The average calculated growth rates during the NPF events were 3 6 times higher than this apparent average growth rate. The result implied that the condensation has a significant role in the particle growth even when NPF is not explicit. Also, the NPF events inside the planetary boundary layer were found to occur in area over a hundred kilometers. However, within this area, a notable variation in nucleation mode particles was observed." nohref="" />

131
Biomarkers measured in organisms are sensitive molecular, cellular or individual level biological effects, which can be applied as  early-warning  signals of environmental contamination before damage occurs at population, community or ecosystem levels. In this thesis, a suite of biomarkers and tissue concentrations of chemicals were measured in mussels (Mytilus trossulus) as indicators of environmental pollution. The mussels were transplanted in specially made cages in coastal areas of the northern Baltic Sea influenced by different types of contamination and environmental factors. The aims of the research were to apply the biomarker approach to (1) assess the impact of contaminants on the health status of mussels, (2) investigate the effects of seasonal variability in biotic and abiotic factors, and low salinity, and (3) validate the usefulness of the mussel caging method for biomonitoring of chemical contamination in the northern Baltic Sea.   The results showed marked biomarker responses coinciding with higher concentrations of contaminants, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), organotins and trace metals, in mussels caged at the most contaminated study sites. At the contaminated sites, for example the enzymatic biomark¬ers of the antioxidant defense system indicated higher stress level, which was closely linked to elevated level of DNA-damage, increased biotransformation activity and decreased general health status of the cells.   Biomarker responses and tissue contaminant concentrations were also related to the seasonal variability in growth and especially in soft tissue weight of the mussels. In the northern Baltic Sea the mussels almost fully deplete their energy stores during the winter; in the spring mussels efficiently feed on the fresh phytoplankton, which forms the main source of energy for their reproduction, energy metabolism and growth. Natural environmental factors caused less variation in the biomarker responses in the late summer and autumn suggesting that this time period is the most suitable for studying contaminant induced effects in mussels.   More pronounced effects were observed in mussels exposed jointly to low salinity and chemical contamination, indicating that increased environmental stress reduces the tolerance of mussels towards anthropogenic pressures. This work showed that the mussel caging approach is an efficient biomonitoring method to assess biological effects and tissue accumulation of complex mixtures of contaminants as long as the effects of seasonal variability and low salinity are taken into account." nohref="" />

The cochlear implant (CI) provides a sensation of hearing for deaf-born children. However, many CI children show poor language outcomes, which may be related to the deficiency of CIs in delivering pitch. This thesis studies the development of those neural processes and behavioural skills linked to the perception of pitch which may play a role in language acquisition. We measured with event-related brain potentials (ERPs) the neural discrimination of and attention shift to changes in music, the perception of word and sentence stress and related acoustic cues, and the auditory working memory (forward digit span) in 46 13-year-old normally hearing (NH) and early-implanted children. We studied how the development of these aspects is related to musical activities known to advance brain development and perceptual skills in the NH population, and whether the perception of music is connected to word stress or visuospatial perception in NH adults.   With regard to the development of neural responses, we found for the CI children usually well-formed ERP waveforms resembling those found for the NH children. However, some brain responses implied impoverished processing for the CI children, especially for timbre and pitch. The CI children who sang regularly at home were advantaged over the other CI children for the development of attention shift, which was linked to improved auditory working memory, implying better neural discrimination, an advantaged development of neural networks for attention and better updating of auditory working memory for the CI singers. For the CI children perception of word and sentence stress improved with improving discrimination of pitch (f0) and intensity and auditory working memory. Only the CI children participating in supervised musical activities performed and developed similarly to the NH children in these skills. The perception of musical rhythm improved with improving word stress and visuospatial perception for the NH adults.   The results indicate that (i) perception of music and speech are connected not only via pitch and timbre, but also via rhythm, and (ii) the combination of singing at home and taking part in supervised musical activities, using also rhythmic exercises and visual cues, might be the best way to optimize pitch-related abilities, underlying cognitive functions, spoken language skills and quality of life for early-implanted children." nohref="" />

The role of individual differences in perceptions of stress has long been recognized. Despite this, the models that are used to measure stress at the workplace the job strain model and the effort-reward imbalance model were developed to assess strenuous work characteristics and their health effects, regardless of the individual. Because work characteristics are usually measured using self-reports the measures cannot be completely objective. The present study examined the susceptibility of the job strain model and the effort-reward imbalance model to Five-Factor personality traits and cynicism. In addition, this study tested the longitudinal measurement invariance of the effort-reward imbalance scales. This study was part of the ongoing prospective, population-based Young Finns study. The measurements for the present study were carried out in 2001, 2007, and 2012. Five-Factor personality traits were assessed with a questionnaire on the Five-Factor model, and cynicism was assessed with a scale derived from the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory. Work characteristics were measured with questionnaires on the job strain model and the effort-reward imbalance model.   The results showed that high neuroticism was associated with higher job strain and higher effort-reward imbalance and that high agreeableness was associated with lower job strain and lower effort-reward imbalance. High extraversion, high openness, and high conscientiousness were associated with lower job strain. Furthermore, high conscientiousness was related to lower effort-reward imbalance only in men. High job strain prospectively predicted higher cynicism six years later. The effort-reward imbalance scales achieved strict longitudinal measurement invariance and showed adequate criterion validity.   Although developed to measure the structural work environment, the job strain model and the effort-reward imbalance model seem to be susceptible to Five-Factor personality traits especially to neuroticism and agreeableness. In addition, high job strain seems to have far reaching consequences on cynical attitudes. Furthermore, the results show that scores on effort-reward imbalance from different time points can reliably be compared with each other. This study shows that organizations and occupational health services should apply a more person-oriented approach to increasing wellbeing at work." nohref="" />

Computational creativity is an area of artificial intelligence that develops algorithms and simulations of creative phenomena, as well as tools for performing creative tasks. In this thesis, we present various computational methods and models of linguistic and musical creativity. The emphasis is on developing methods that are maximally unsupervised, i.e. methods that require a minimal amount of hand-crafted linguistic, world, or domain knowledge.   This thesis consists of an introductory part and five original research articles. The introductory part outlines computational creativity as a research field and discusses some of the philosophical foundations underlying the current work. The research articles present specific methods and algorithms for automatic composition of poetry and songs. The first article proposes a corpus-based poetry generation method that relies on statistical language modelling and morphological analysis and synthesis. In the second article, we expand that basic model with constraint programming techniques to handle more aspects of the poetic structure and style. The third article presents a method for mining document-specific word associations and proposes using them in poetry generation to produce poems based, for instance, on a specific news story. The fourth article presents a song composition system that utilises constraint programming to produce songs with matching lyrics and music in a transformational way, i.e. it is able to modify its own search space and preferences. Transformationality of the system is achieved with a metalevel component that can modify the system's internal constraints leading into new conceptual spaces. Finally, the fifth article discusses possibilities of combining personal biosignal measurements, especially electroencephalography, with techniques of computational creativity and presents an art installation called Brain Poetry based on these ideas.   The current work relies heavily on the use of unsupervised data mining techniques to automatically build models of specific creative domains such as poetry. The proposed methods and models are flexible and they are to a large extent independent of language and style. Thus, they provide a general framework for computational or synthetic creativity in linguistic and musical domains that can be easily expanded in many ways. Applications of this work include pedagogical tools, computer games, and artistic results." nohref="" />

Tenkanen, Tommi

127
Cosmic inflation, an era of rapid expansion in the early universe, and dark matter, an unknown non-baryonic matter component exceeding the amount of the usual baryonic matter by a factor of five, are known to play an important role in describing the physics of the early universe and in explaining the contents of the universe we observe today. Yet the reason for the occurrence of inflation and for the production of dark matter, or their properties, are not known.   In this thesis we study the observational consequences of a class of particle physics models related to inflation and dark matter which are challenging to test by direct experiments, such as particle colliders, but which can be tested by cosmological and astrophysical observations. In particular, we concentrate on observational properties of self-interacting Higgs portal dark matter. Whenever a model contains scalar fields which are light and energetically subdominant during cosmic inflation, so-called  spectator fields , they acquire large fluctuations which may leave observable imprints on the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation.   Carefully investigating the spectator field dynamics during cosmic inflation, we solve for typical initial conditions for post-inflationary dynamics and calculate the dark matter yield originating from non-thermal decay of spectator condensates. As a result, we find a novel connection between the energy scale of inflation and the dark matter abundance. We also study alternative thermal histories of hidden sector dark matter and demonstrate how the usual dark matter production mechanisms may not be sufficient to correctly describe the evolution of dark matter relic density from its generation to the present day.   We show that even if the coupling between the hidden and visible sectors is almost negligible, the scenario has observable consequences. Especially a positive observation of primordial tensor perturbations would immensely affect not only models of inflation but also very weakly coupled dark matter models, ruling out large portions of the otherwise viable parameter space. The derived bounds are generic to most weakly coupled portal models with light scalar fields, and qualitatively similar results are also expected to arise in other portal type extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics." nohref="" />

Different dyadic techniques are an inseparable part of modern-day harmonic analysis both in the Euclidean space and in metric spaces. In this dissertation, we improve adjacent and random dyadic techniques in metric spaces and apply these and previously known techniques for questions related to metric, Euclidean and vector-valued analysis.   The dissertation consists of an introductory part and four research articles. In the first article, we present a general randomization procedure for dyadic systems in metric spaces which can be used for constructing both random and adjacent dyadic systems. As an application of the new random systems, we improve the continuity properties of metric wavelets of P. Auscher and T. Hytönen by exploiting the improved ``smallness of boundary'' property of our random cubes. In the third article, we prove some additional properties for our adjacent dyadic systems to prove a decomposition result for dyadic systems in metric spaces. With its help, we give an alternative proof for the quantitative bound of the Lp norm of shift operators acting on vector-valued functions in metric spaces.   In the second article, we explore certain properties of the Muckenhoupt weight classes, the class of Reverse Hölder weights and their weakened versions in spaces of homogeneous type. In the Euclidean setting, the Muckenhoupt weight classes have numerous different equivalent definitions but in spaces of homogeneous type some of those equivalences break down. We show that although certain definitions are no longer equivalent in this context, their weakened versions still define the same weight classes. We also show that every weak Reverse Hölder weight has a self-improving property. In the literature, these types of weak weights appear especially in the theory of partial differential equations.   In the fourth article, we prove quantitative weighted bounds for so called rough homogeneous singular integrals by combining older techniques with a quantitative version of M. Lacey's recent extension of the A2 theorem. The proof of this extension is based on a domination technique which provides a way to dominate Calderón-Zygmund operators pointwise with the help of a finite number of simple sparse operators associated with adjacent dyadic systems." nohref="" />

The present study explores the intersection of the institutional and the Rhetorical Presidency. By recognizing that the American presidency is an institution---an embodiment of the government---a researcher looks closely not only at the President as an individual, but also at the aggregate of people who co-create the institution. The Rhetorical Presidency marks the major transformation in the pattern of communication and governance of the US Presidents in the twentieth century. In consequence of that transformation, presidential speeches have, allegedly, routinized and the White House started to rely increasingly on professional wordsmiths, rather than policy experts for speechwriting. In addition, audible and visible aspects of presidential performance became more and more important.   By reawakening attention to the State of the Union Address (Sotu)---the only constitutionally mandated communication between the President and Congress that was instrumental in the development of the President's legislative leadership---the present study seeks to explore whether and in what way the changes associated with the emergence of the Rhetorical Presidency may have affected, what Charles J. /G. Griffin called,  the speech writing infrastructure ---that is the people and procedures which were responsible for coordinating the State of the Union preparatory process under presidents: Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Gerald R. Ford and George H. W. Bush.   Based on the analysis of archival materials pertaining to the processes of producing the Sotu during the above-mentioned presidencies, the present study challenges some generalizations attributed to the rise of the Rhetorical Presidency. By analyzing the involvement of policy experts, speechwriters, and the selected Presidents in the Sotu process, the present study throws light on the actual impact of the transformation in the pattern of communication on drafting and the presentation of the State of the Union Addresses. As most speeches nowadays are believed to be written as instant White House responses to issues and handed to the President on the way to the podium, the Sotu process requires deliberation of the entire government. In spite of the increasing specialization of the staff s functions, the President s success or failure is also shaped by his own efforts. In fact, the Presidents have become involved in activities that go beyond the scope of their formal constitutional powers and started to play an increasingly active role in all stages of the Sotu preparatory process, including drafting, an activity which with the rise of the Rhetorical Presidency is assumed to have become a domain of professional language experts or wordsmiths. A slight reversal in the overall trend was observed in the organization of the speechwriting infrastructure in the Bush White House.   Also, in consequence of the shift to popular leadership, a further shift---beyond words---and towards visual leadership---took place. Modern leadership requires more than mere actions and words. Modern Sotus are designed to be heard, not read. Importantly, as LBJ s case illustrates, visual leadership remains complementary, yet inseparable, to legislative leadership.   By emphasizing the rhetorical dimension of the office, the Rhetorical Presidency imposes demands on the presidency that contribute to making the Sotu preparatory process so time-consuming and convoluted---the toughest season in the White House.   Keywords: State of the Union, rhetorical presidency, institutional presidency, speechwriting, speechmaking." nohref="" />

124
Atmospheric aerosol particles affect public health, environment, weather and climate in various ways, and therefore the importance on obtaining information about their spatial and temporal variation is evident. Remote sensing measurements have particular capability to provide broad horizontal and/or vertical view on the ambient aerosol field from local to global scales. They also can provide observations over remote areas where carrying out in situ measurements is not possible. The aim of this Thesis, is to explore both ground-based and spaceborne remote sensing measurement techniques for monitoring aerosol particles, and their applications on air quality as well as climate studies.   In the first part of this Thesis the potential of a ground-based ceilometer-type lidar to be used as an aerosol measurement device is investigated. Ceilometers are originally designed for observing cloud heights, and at the time of the study they were not commonly used to monitor aerosols. The results obtained in this study indicate that the absolute accuracy of a ceilometer-type lidar is sufficient for quantitative aerosol measurements in some applications.   The first study using an improved version of the AATSR (Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer) satellite algorithm shows that aerosol optical depth (AOD) can be retrieved with sufficient accuracy over Eastern China, where the aerosol conditions are highly variable and therefore challenging from the satellite remote sensing point of view. In addition, the improved version of the algorithm provides also valuable information about the fine mode particle contribution to the total AOD. The satellite based AOD data is also used to evaluate the performance of a coupled climate-aerosol model. The comparison of ECHAM5-HAM model and satellite-based AOD (from MODerate Imaging Spectroradiometer) showed that, with few exceptions, the model reproduced relatively well the spatiotemporal variation of AOD over India and China.   In this Thesis it is also shown that satellite data can be used to derive such climatically relevant quantities that are not directly available in common retrieval products (such as e.g. AOD). By combining coincident observations from two different satellite instruments, an observation-based estimate of the clear-sky shortwave aerosol direct radiative effect ADRE (at the top of the atmosphere) can be established. Results of the case study over Eastern China show that, overall, the satellite-based estimates of ADRE, aerosol-free fluxes, and their spatial variation are in agreement with model-based values." nohref="" />

Suila, Heli

123
Stem cells have a unique ability to both self-renew and differentiate into diverse cell types and they harbor remarkable potential in therapeutic applications. Stem cells can be isolated from various sources of both embryonic and adult origin. During the past decade, research on stem cells has rapidly expanded, but many issues of stem cell biology and their clinical use remain unresolved. There is a need for methods to thoroughly characterize therapeutic cell populations, to better distinguish them from other cells, and to control variation within and between different cell preparations.   The surface of stem cells, like all other human cell surfaces, is covered by a complex network of glycans. This is the outmost layer of cells, called the glycocalyx. The glycocalyx is characteristic to and different in every cell type and reflects even subtle changes in cell behaviour and for example cell differentiation. Cell surface glycans are the first cellular components encountered by approaching cells, pathogens, signalling molecules and other binders, making the terminal glycan units key players in cell interactions and signalling. Due to their prominent cell surface localization, glycan epitopes can be utilized for identifying and isolating specific cell types from heterogeneous populations.   The aim of this study was to characterize relevant glycan structures on umbilical cord blood derived stem and progenitor cells, to study how they are regulated and to determine their influence on stem cell biology. As decribed in the original publications of this study, we were able to characterize two novel glycan determinants, O-GlcNAc and linear poly-LacNAc, on umbilical cord blood derived mesenchymal stromal cells (UCB-MSCs). We further discovered that galectins-1 and -3 secreted by these cells are bound on the cell surface and that the cell surface galectin-1 interacts with P-selectin. This interaction is likely to play a role in the immunomodulatory homing of UCB-MSCs to sites of injury or inflammation. In addition, we present the effects and potential use of metabolic glycoengineering of UCB-MSC.   Taken together, these studies provide new insights into the glycobiology of UCB derived stem and progenitor cells. This information may help to distinguish better cell populations for distinct therapeutic applications and to design therapeutic cells with enhanced biological properties." nohref="" />

This dissertation studies classical questions in the field of geometric analysis in the context of metric spaces.   The dissertation is comprised of three research articles. The first is on the connection of quasiconformal maps and the quasihyperbolic metric. The remaining two concern notions of homotopy classes of Sobolev type maps between metric spaces, comparison with the manifold case, and the existence of minimizers of a p-energy in these homotopy classes.   The unifying theme of all three articles is analysis on metric spaces. That is, all three papers deal with questions concerning maps between metric spaces. The particular type of metric spaces involved is generally referred to as PI-spaces.   PI-spaces satisfy conditions allowing one to extend a large part of classical first order calculus, such as the theory of Sobolev maps and, á posteriori, differentiability of Lipschitz functions." nohref="" />

Söderholm, Sandra

121
Phosphorylation is one of the most important post-translational modifications of proteins. Phosphorylation is a rapid and reversible way of modifying proteins; it is involved in the regulation of many cellular processes, serving as the main transducer of intracellular signaling cascades. It is possible to identify thousands of protein phosphorylation sites from a single sample with mass spectrometry (MS)-based phosphoproteomics. This is the main reason why MS-based phosphoproteomics is such an excellent method for revealing global changes in phosphoproteomes. Computational analysis of the MS data is vital for identifying the proteins and post-translational modifications. The data analysis steps in the phosphoproteomics workflow are also crucial for biological interpretation, e.g. identifying activated kinases and kinase substrates, as well as unravelling signaling pathways and networks.   Cells of the innate immune system are central players in the host defence against pathogens such as viruses. Their pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which are conserved structures present in pathogens. The most important PAMPs in viral infections are the viral genomes and replication intermediates, and their detection evokes pro-inflammatory and antiviral responses in the infected cell. Host factors and signaling cascades that promote or inhibit virus infections can serve as potential drug targets. Since protein phosphorylation is vital for the progression of nearly all signaling cascades, there is an increasing interest in applying phosphoproteomics and combining it with bioinformatics in studying the regulation of cellular signaling under various conditions, including viral infections.   The main aim of the studies included in this PhD thesis was to characterize the global changes in the cellular phosphoproteomes of virus infected and dsRNA stimulated innate immune cells, and to identify the host proteins and cell signaling pathways involved in the early stages of the host response to Sendai virus (SeV), influenza A virus (IAV), and viral dsRNA. A computational analysis tool, named PhosFox, was developed for processing and comparing MS-based phosphoproteomic data generated by multiple database search algorithms. PhosFox was used for cross-sample comparisons of phosphopeptide identifications. PhosFox also facilitated the identification of those proteins whose phosphorylation was different between samples, and the clarification of phosphorylation sites not described in the literature. The findings from the phosphoproteomic data were explored further by implementing functional studies involving small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and kinase inhibitors. There were extensive alterations in the phosphorylation of proteins in human epithelial cells and macrophages that were transfected with the synthetic dsRNA-mimic polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (pI:C) or infected with SeV or IAV. Many of these proteins were determined to be members of pathways with little or no previously known role in the antiviral response to these particular viruses and viral PAMPs. Two novel host factors, RelA-associated inhibitor (RAI) and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), were identified as negative regulators of dsRNA-induced apoptosis and NF-ºB regulated cytokine expression by combining 14-3-3 interactome and phosphoproteome characterizations. The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway was found to be regulating cytokine expression and apoptosis in dsRNA-transfected human keratinocytes. MAPK signaling pathways were also regulated in SeV and IAV infected cells. The mTOR signaling pathway was shown to be critical for the interferon response and virus replication in SeV infected human lung epithelial cells. A substantial number of those cellular proteins whose phosphorylation status changed after SeV or IAV infection or viral dsRNA challenge were involved in Rho GTPase signaling. Major changes in protein phosphorylation in IAV infected primary human macrophages were linked to cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). CDK activity was shown to be required for efficient viral replication and host response in IAV infection. Administration of one specific CDK inhibitor, SNS-032, also protected mice from IAV-induced death.   The studies included in this PhD thesis are some of the first to apply phosphoproteomics for characterizing host-virus interactions. They emphazise the benefit of applying phosphoproteomics and bioinformatics in innate immunity and viral research, i.e. it is possible not only to identify cell signaling pathways, but also the specific host factors that regulate the cellular responses to viral infections. The results of these studies underline the importance and the potential MS-based phosphoproteomics has in the discovery of novel host factors, which can serve as possible antiviral drug targets. In conclusion, the MS-based phosphoproteomics approach led to the discovery of novel host factors and cell signaling circuits in virus infected innate immune cells." nohref="" />

Adsorption and clustering induce changes in the vibrational spectra. The main focus of this work is to study some of these changes in a controlled manner for the systems of water and ammonia molecules. The systems that I study are water molecule adsorbed on the Cu(110) surface, ammonia molecule adsorbed on the (111) fcc transition metal surfaces, and the hydrogen-bonded water-ammonia complex. The metal surface is the perturbing environment in adsorption studies. The water and ammonia molecules serve as the perturbing environment for each other in the water-ammonia complex.   Density functional theory and coupled cluster calculations have been used to obtain the potential energy surfaces for the adsorption systems and the water-ammonia complex, respectively. The anharmonic vibrational Hamiltonians have been obtained by combining the exact gas phase kinetic energy operators with the potential energy surfaces which are calculated in the presence of the perturbing environment. The vibrational energy levels have been calculated variationally. The procedure explained above gives us the energy levels for the high-frequency vibrations that are mainly localized on the water and ammonia molecules. These vibrations are also present in the isolated molecules.   For the adsorption system the largest approximation in the procedure explained above is the use of density functional theory. This error is successfully corrected by calculating the adsorption induced shifts instead of the absolute vibrational energy levels. The adiabatic approximation that separates the vibrational motion of the molecule and the perturbing environment from each other is the biggest approximation for the water-ammonia complex. This error is corrected by including one crucial intermolecular mode into the vibrational model. Finally, the systematic trends upon adsorption are studied for the ammonia molecule adsorbed on several metal surfaces." nohref="" />

The thesis deals with the use of counterfactuals in historiography from the point of view of causal explanation. It studies the various roles that counterfactual claims and counterfactual reasoning play in causal explanation and causal thinking in historiography. The aim is to defend the use of counterfactual  what if -questions and inferences in the context of causal explanation and to create methodological guidelines for that use. The theory that is used in this thesis to explicate the role counterfactuals in causal explanation is the contrastive counterfactual theory of causal explanation.   The thesis consists of five discussion chapters. The second chapter introduces the basic concepts of the thesis and analyzes the debate on counterfactuals that has churned among historians within the past decades. The arguments of the opponents of counterfactual reasoning are divided into four categories: metaphysical arguments, semantic arguments, epistemological arguments and arguments based on historians  disciplinary identity. The analysis of the arguments of the defenders of counterfactuals shows that there is a missing link in their main argument according to which the use of counterfactuals in historiography is justified because counterfactuals and causal reasoning are inherently linked together. The argument needs to be filled with a theory of causal explanation   the contrastive counterfactual theory   that explicitly shows how causal claims are related to counterfactual claims and helps to solve various methodological problems related to the use of counterfactuals in historiography.   In the third chapter the history and basic ideas   most notably the ideas of contrastive explanandum and ideal intervention   of the contrastive counterfactual theory are jotted down. It is showed how contrastive counterfactual theory deals successfully with the problems that have haunted the other counterfactual theories of causal explanation. Chapters four, five and six are dedicated to applying the contrastive counterfactual theory to the most puzzling questions in philosophy of historiography in order to see how far the ideas of contrastive causal explanatory claims and ideal interventions can go in solving these issues. Chapter four shows how the theory solves e.g. the problems of separating explanatory causes from background factors and the question to what extent historians  causal explanations can be said to be objective. The final sections of the chapter compare the contrastive counterfactual theory both to the non-causalist view of explaining human action and to the covering-law model on scientific explanation. Based on the comparisons it is concluded that the contrastive counterfactual theory can be considered to be the most fruitful theory to approach the problems of historiographical explanation.   Chapter five deals with the epistemology and methodology of causal and counterfactual inferences in historiography. The method of process tracing is introduced as a way to make use of evidence to support causal and counterfactual claims. Historians  evidence consists of traces of the past, as well as, of general theoretical ideas on the mechanisms that guide human behavior, society and culture. It is argued that it is sometimes extremely difficult or even impossible to assess the truth of some counterfactual claims due to the lack of evidence that historians often face. The idea of ideal intervention and its conditions are introduced to solve some of the major conceptual and methodological problems of causal and counterfactual reasoning in historiography, e.g. the problem how to choose sensible counterfactual antecedents. It is shown that complexity and non-modularity of the systems studied is the other major source of difficulty for historians  causal and counterfactual inferences, in addition to the problems caused by the lack of evidence. In the end of the chapter, the difference between historians  counterfactual could-inferences and would-inferences is explicated, and it is argued why would-inferences are central to causal explanation, whereas could-inferences serve the goals of tracking moral responsibility and prevention.   Chapter six discusses the uses of counterfactuals in historians  causal reasoning. It is suggested that historians engage in four types of reasoning when they weigh causes in order to determine their causal significance or importance. It is also shown how the ideas of the contrastive counterfactual theory can be applied in all these cases. First of all, historians seek to select causes by separating them from the causal background. Secondly, historians can weigh causes with the help of using various contrastive explanatory questions. Thirdly, they try to assess the necessity and contingency of a result, and fourthly, they are interested in defining the sensitivity of causal relations. The final section of the thesis presents how counterfactual reasoning works in the construction of historiographical narratives.   The final closing chapter seeks to give a balanced answer to the arguments of the critics who question the use of counterfactuals in historiography, and to provide a toolkit for counterfactual explanatory reasoning in historiography based on the findings of the previous chapters. In addition, the results are assessed from the point of view of the contrastive counterfactual theory in order to evaluate whether the theory needs further developing.   Most of the topics discussed in the thesis are illustrated with examples mainly from political history, social history, history of international relations, and economic history. The arguments and conclusions should, however, be applicable to all fields of historiography." nohref="" />

We constrain cosmological models where the primordial perturbations have an adiabatic and a (possi- bly correlated) cold dark matter (CDI), neutrino density (NDI) or neutrino velocity (NVI) isocurvature component. We use both a phenomenological approach, where the power spectra of primordial per- turbations are parametrized with two amplitudes at two different scales, and a slow-roll two-field inflation approach where inflation slow-roll parameters are used as primary parameters, determining the spectral indices and the ratio of tensor perturbations to scalar perturbations. We use WMAP 7- year and 9-year data combined with other CMB data and Planck 2013 CMB temperature anisotropy data. Bayesian methods indicate no preference for any of the isocurvature modes: the CMB data set tight upper bounds on any non-adiabatic contribution to the observed CMB temperature variance. We show that allowing for a primordial tensor contribution has a negligible effect on the determi- nation of the non-adiabatic contribution and vice versa, as long as the tensor spectral index obeys the first inflationary consistency relation. On large scales, the WMAP CMB data seem to constrain isocurvature tighter than the Planck data. This is due to the lack of power at low multipoles, l "< 2...40, in the Planck data compared to the prediction of the best-fitting adiabatic CDM model. Hence the Planck data prefer a power-reducing mechanism, which the mixed adiabatic and isocurva- ture models with negative correlation or full anticorrelation can offer. With WMAP 9-year data we find that in the NDI and NVI cases larger isocurvature fractions are allowed than in the correspond- ing models with CDI. For uncorrelated perturbations, the upper limit to the primordial NDI (NVI) fraction is 24% (20%) at k = 0.002Mpc"1 and 28% (16%) at k = 0.01Mpc"1. For maximally correlated (anticorrelated) perturbations, the upper limit to the NDI fraction is 3.0% (0.9%). The non-adiabatic contribution to the CMB temperature variance can be 10% ( 13%) for the NDI (NVI) modes. For Planck data the non-adiabatic contribution to the temperature variance can be up to 7%, 9%, 5% in the CDI, NDI, NVI models. The Planck data constrain the primordial CDI fraction in specific curvaton and axion scenarios to 0.25% and 3.9%, respectively. All bounds above are at 95% CL. With the WMAP data, relaxing the pure adiabaticity assumption leads to large shifts of the preferred values of standard cosmological parameters and broadening of their posterior probability distributions. In contrast, as the Planck data determines the acoustic peak structure precisely up to the sixth acoustic peak, allowing for a mixture of the primordial adiabatic and an isocurvature mode does not significantly affect the determination of standard cosmological parameters." nohref="" />

Ferroelectric materials show many promising features for applications in tomorrow s electronics. The ability to use polarization to store information in a dense space and good endurance make them one of the top contestants for the next generation memory applications, such as Ferroelectric or Resistive Random-Access Memory elements (FeRAM / ReRAM). The ReRAM elements are also a promising type for the missing circuit element, memristor, which links together the magnetic induction flux and the electric charge.  Some materials also exhibit simultaneous ferroelectric polarization and magnetization. These are called multiferroics and could be a key towards magnetoelectric memories and a realization of four-state logic in a single device.  A solid state ceramic, BiFeO 3 , has been under recent interest for such a multiferroic material since it exhibits large polarization simultaneously with magnetization. The challenges of BiFeO 3 include its high conductivity for an insulator and poor phase stability. Other materials with similar unit cell structure have been mixed with the material to successfully improve the properties.  In this work, the ferroelectric properties of a ceramic solid state compound 0.80[BiFe 0.95 Mn 0.05 O 3 ]  0.20[BaTiO 3 ], or BFBT(Mn), were investigated under various electrical measurements. The results show that the material is ferroelectric. They also show that the conduction mechanism inside the material varies with the applied electric field, hinting to Space Charge Limited Conduction mechanism and Resistive Switching. The phenomenon is expected to be linked to migration of oxygen vacancies inside the sample and formation of conductive filaments." nohref="" />

My dissertation is a comprehensive grammatical description of the Wutun language (ISO 639-3 WUH), a distinct local form of Northwest Mandarin spoken by approximately 4000 people in Upper Wutun, Lower Wutun and Jiacangma villages in Tongren County, Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, People s Republic of China. While the basic vocabulary and grammatical morphemes of Wutun are mainly of Chinese origin, it has adapted phonologically and structurally to its current linguistic environment, where varieties of Amdo Tibetan are dominant regional languages and lingua francas. The Tibetan influence manifests itself in all domains of Wutun grammatical structure, including phonology, morphology, syntax and lexicon. This has yielded some phonological and grammatical properties that are unusual for a Sinitic language and cross-linguistically rare, including the size of the phoneme inventory, multiple aspect marking and egophoricity. In addition, there are some grammatical features, such as the paucal-plural distinction and sociative case marking, which represent areal interference from Bonan, a small Mongolic language spoken in the immediate vicinity of Wutun-speaking villages.   The dissertation is based on first-hand field data collected during three field trips to the province of Qinghai in June-August 2007, June-August 2010 and June-July 2013. My data consists of approximately 1300 clauses of descriptive and narrative texts as well as conversations that were complemented by elicitation and grammaticality judgements. The theoretical framework used for language description is based on an informal descriptive theory referred to in the literature as Basic Linguistic Theory (BLT) (Dixon 1997, 2010; Dryer 2006). My dissertation aims to detail aspects of Wutun phonology, morphology and syntax, including phoneme inventory, noun phrase, verb complex, minor word classes, clause structure, non-declarative speech acts and clause combining. It also includes an appendix with three oral texts in Wutun.   It is my hope that the present study will be accessible to a wide audience, including linguists working on Sino-Tibetan languages, languages of Northwest China, linguistic typology and historical linguistics." nohref="" />

In this work, an automated procedure for extracting chemical profiles of illicit drugs from chromatographic-mass spectrometric data is presented along with a method for comparison of the profiles using Bayesian inference. The described methods aim to ease the work of a forensic chemist who is tasked with comparing two samples of a drug, such as amphetamine, and delivering an answer to a question of the form  Are these two samples from the same source?   Additionally, more statistical rigour is introduced to the process of comparison.  The chemical profiles consist of the relative amounts of certain impurities present in seized drug samples. In order to obtain such profiles, the amounts of the target compounds must be recovered from chromatographic-mass spectrometric measurements, which amounts to searching the raw signals for peaks corresponding to the targets. The areas of these peaks must then be integrated and normalized by the sum of all target peak areas.  The automated impurity profile extraction presented in this thesis works by first filtering the data corresponding to a sample, which includes discarding irrelevant parts of the raw data, estimating and removing signal baseline using the asymmetrical reweighed penalized least squares (arPLS) algorithm, and smoothing the relevant signals using a Savitzky-Golay (SG) filter. The SG filter is also used to estimate signal derivatives. These derivatives are used in the next step to detect signal peaks from which parameters are estimated for an exponential-Gaussian hybrid peak model. The signal is reconstructed using the estimated model peaks and optimal parameters are found by fitting the reconstructed signal to the measurements via non-linear least squares methods. In the last step, impurity profiles are extracted by integrating the areas of the optimized models for target compound peaks. These areas are then normalized by their sum to obtain relative amounts of the substances.  In order to separate the peaks from noise, a model for noise dependency on signal level was fitted to replicate measurements of amphetamine quality control samples non-parametrically. This model was used to compute detection limits based on estimated baseline of the signals.  Finally, the classical Pearson correlation based comparison method for these impurity profiles was compared to two Bayesian methods, the Bayes factor (BF) and the predictive agreement(PA). The Bayesian methods used a probabilistic model assuming normally distributed values with normal-gamma prior distribution for the mean and precision parameters. These methods were compared using simulation tests and application to 90 samples of seized amphetamine." nohref="" />

Organisms have environmental requirements in order to grow and reproduce. These restrictions concerning environmental requirements lead to the overall distribution of organisms. Alterations in the environment leads to acclimatisation, changes in distribution or even extinction of a species in the specific environment. Eutrophication, increase of nutrients and consequently the general productivity level, is a global phenomenon in the aquatic environment. In the Baltic Sea, the progress of eutrophication has been observed since the 1960s. The central issue in my thesis is the shift in an environmental condition, i.e. the increase of water turbidity due to increased primary production and the effects of turbidity on predatory fish, i.e. larval pike. In general, phytoplankton-induced turbidity deteriorates the visual environment by absorbing visible light. Depending on the fish species in question, this can have positive, negative or neutral effects on predator-prey interactions.   In addition to effects of water turbidity, my thesis focuses on the ramifications of the quality and quantity of prey on first-feeding larval pike in the nursery grounds of the northern Baltic Sea archipelago areas. The amount of suitable prey is important for effective growth. Rapid growth is essential for larvae, as growing larvae becomes more aware of their surroundings, and are more able to avoid contact with predators and escape attacks. The quality of zooplankton as prey is affected by community species composition, phytoplankton community composition, temperature and eutrophication for example. The quality, in turn, has a direct impact on the growth and development of planktivorous fish.   Pike populations have diminished in some coastal areas of the Baltic Sea since the 1970s, and the catches have collapsed in areas where environmental changes have been considerable. My thesis included two field studies, where environmental factors (salinity, turbidity, temperature, oxygen concentration, wave exposure) and important resources (zooplankton quantity and community structure) are related to the distribution and condition of pike larvae. I also conducted two sets of experiments that focused on the effects of turbidity and food quality on prey capture and larval growth.   According to my results, phytoplankton-induced turbidity has a negative effect on larval pike condition and growth. Turbidity also impacts prey capture negatively by diminishing the number of copepods captured. In my experiment the quality of prey, measured as fatty acids, was higher in the outer site than in the inner site. Both increased water turbidity and food quality affected the growth of larval pike when food quantity was kept constant. However, more sites from both inner and outer archipelago zones should be surveyed in the future to find out whether this is a trend or an outcome of this experiment. There were also other factors that affected the larval pike populations in the two areas; the density of zooplankton is higher in the inner archipelago sites compared with the outer archipelago sites while the density and condition of larval pike were decreasing towards the outer archipelago sites simultaneously with increasing exposition to pelagic circumstances. The occurrence and density of important prey species help explain the distribution of larval pike in the archipelago areas, but as larval pike do not disperse much from the spawning grounds; this is also related to adult pike spawning behaviour. The countries surrounding the Baltic Sea have made actions to diminish the amount of allochtonous nutrients entering the sea. Even though many projects have led to a decrease of these substances, the nutrient load is still quite high as the internal loading of nutrients sustains the eutrophicated and turbid conditions of the sea for a long period of time." nohref="" />

Neurons have distinctive polar morphology with distinctive subcellular features comprising of cell soma, axons and dendrites. Primary objective of this study was to develop a novel microfluidic device for spatial isolation of axons from the somatodendritic compartment of cultured hippocampal neurons. A new method was developed for asymmetrical genetic manipulation improving specificity in studies of how individual proteins affect axonal morphology, presynaptic development and function. Subsequently, the microfluidic culture system was used to study the signaling events involved in synaptogenesis, focusing on the roles of kainate type of glutamate receptors (KARs). Functional studies have shown that KARs are present in axons and may regulate presynaptic function. However, the molecular composition and detailed subcellular localization of axonal KARs as well as their roles in presynaptic differentiation are largely unknown.   The results show that axonal KARs promote early stages of synaptogenesis. Expression of low (GluK1-3) and high affinity (GluK4-5) KAR subunits promoted filopodiogenesis function at the isolated axons. In addition, axonal low affinity subunits enhanced clustering of synaptic vesicles and transmission efficacy at nascent glutamatergic synapses, an effect which was associated with widening of presynaptic active zone. High affinity KAR subunits had no effect on synaptic vesicle clustering, nor presynaptic transmission efficacy. However their heteromerization with low affinity subunits completely prevented the synapse promoting effects and instead lead to strong inhibition of presynaptic transmission efficacy. The presynaptic effects of GluK1-3 on synaptic vesicle clustering involved both PKA and PKC pathways. GluK1 expression was developmentally regulated in neonatal and juvenile hippocampus and heteromeric combination of GluK1c with high affinity subunits suppressed glutamatergic synaptic transmission.   KARs are linked to various neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. Our observations and previous findings strongly suggest that KARs are involved in morphological maturation of neurons and in refinement of neuronal circuitry in the brain. The present results provide novel insights into the involvement of different types of KAR subunits in synaptic development and morphological differentiation. Hence, they are potential therapeutic targets in various developmentally originating neurological disorders." nohref="" />

Common materials acquire new properties when manufactured in the nanoscale. The same properties that are responsible for the exciting new possibilities are also a cause for some concern. The high surface area to volume ratio is a feature of engineered nanomaterials (ENM) that causes the amount of surface area to dominate their possible effects. In the case of carbon nanomaterials and other fibers, also the shape and length of the particle play important roles. The two ENM studied in this thesis, nanosized titanium dioxide (TiO2) and carbon nanotubes (CNT), are among the most widely used ENM in the world which means that they hold a high potential of occupational and possible customer exposure.   Inhalation is the most likely exposure route in occupational settings. For this reason, inhalation exposure of mice was the main route of administration. The study settings were chosen to mimic occupational exposure as far as possible. Different immunological parameters were examined in the lungs of the exposed mice, such as the influx of different leucocytes, expression of cytokine and chemokine messenger molecules and changes in the lung tissue.   The results from TiO2 studies indicated that even a normally inert material when nanosized may become inflammogenic. In addition, even small changes in the structure, or even a coating, may modify radically the nature of a material. Exposure to most nanosized TiO2 caused only modest to no inflammation, whereas a silica (SiO2) coated TiO2 triggered an inflammation characterized by pulmonary neutrophilia and mRNA expression of neutrophil chemoattractant CXCL1 and proinflammatory TNF-±. In tissues and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), TiO2 was readily engulfed by macrophages. In a model of allergic asthma, it was found that exposure to both nanosized and larger TiO2 seemed to prevent asthmatic symptoms. This underlines the importance of bearing in mind the heterogeneity of the human population when assessing the toxicity of ENM. CNT have raised some serious concerns in the scientific community and the media due to their similarity in structure to asbestos. Here, a remarkable new type of eosinophilic inflammation was observed in long rigid CNT exposed mice after a week of inhalation to these particles. This inflammation was characterized by strong eosinophilia, goblet cell hyperplasia, Th2 type cytokines and increased airway hyper-responsiveness to methacholine. All of the above symptoms have previously been described as symptoms of classical asthma. Transcriptomic analyses revealed radical up-regulation of innate immunity and cytokine/chemokine pathways. There were also roles found for mast cells and alveolar macrophages in orchestrating the inflammation.   Lastly in the only exposure conducted by aspiration, mice were exposed to two long CNT (rigid/R and tangled/T) and to crocidolite asbestos. From a few hours to 28 days after a single exposure, there was a striking inflammatory cascade starting with macrophages and neutrophils, progressing to eosinophilic inflammation and eventually terminating as granulomas, goblet cell hyperplasia, Charcot-Leyden-like crystals and the mRNA expression of IL-1², TGF-², TNF-± and IL-13. The most dramatic inflammation was seen in the R/CNT group, followed by asbestos with T/CNT being clearly more weakly inflammogenic.   In summary, inhalation exposure especially to certain fibrous nanomaterials seems to cause strong pulmonary inflammation. This may put exposed individuals at risk of developing lung diseases. In addition to the material of the nanoparticle, two important factors in risk evaluation are the shape of the particle and the possible modification made (e.g. coating) to the particle. The model of allergic asthma demonstrated that an underlying inflammatory condition can greatly affect the inflammatory outcome seen after nanoparticle exposure. The results of this thesis help to understand the underlying mechanisms in nanoparticle induced pulmonary inflammation." nohref="" />

The effect of systemically and locally administered clodronate on bone quality   The aims of this study were to evaluate the effect of clodronate, given systemically or locally, on the quality of bone and to develop a combination product including clodronate and bioactive glass for local administration in the treatment of periodontitis. The beneficial effects of clodronate on bone are known. Clodronate inhibits osteoclasts in bone and reduces bone turnover. It is used in breast cancer patients with non-osseous metastases to reduce the osteolytic complications and bone metastases. It is widely investigated e.g., in healthy women reducing bone loss. The first aim of this thesis was to investigate whether these established effects are similar in women with primary operable breast cancer.   Since skeletal bone loss and alveolar bone loss in periodontitis share common mechanisms, the effect of clodronate upon dental application was of interest. Systemic bone conditions impact the periodontium and systemically administered clodronate positively affects the peridontium, but also side effects such as diarrhea, rash and osteonecrosis of the jaw can be problematic. However, clodronate is poorly absorbed from gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the oral bioavailability of clodronate is low. Therefore, systemically administered oral dose of clodronate needs to be high to achieve a therapeutic effect, which in turn leads to increased adverse events. Therefore, the challenge in developing novel drug delivery systems for clodronate is to achieve improved bioavailability and safety. The aim of the second part of this thesis was to develop a new delivery system that would reach the target site in the periodontium, while limiting unwanted side effects and reducing the required dose through local administration.   In the first part of this study, the loss of bone mineral density (BMD) was studied in patients with primary operable breast cancer given either clodronate or placebo. Oral clodronate appears to reduce the loss of bone in these patients. In premenopausal patients clodronate significantly reduced the loss of bone after one year and in postmenopausal patients clodronate increased the spinal BMD. Patients receiving clodronate had significantly more incidences of diarrhea than those receiving placebo. This indicates that clodronate is poorly absorbed from GI tract thus causing irritation to the intestine. In addition, the development of bone metastases was compared with patients with primary operable breast cancer given either clodronate or placebo. Clodronate given to these patients was shown to reduce the occurrence of bone metastases. Additionally, there was a significant reduction in mortality.   In the second part of the study, a novel combination product of bioactive glass (BAG, SiO2 53%, Na2O 23%, CaO 20% and P2O5 4% (w/w %)) and clodronate was investigated. Firstly, preformulation studies were performed. Clodronate was found to promote the activity of the BAG and a calcium clodronate precipitate formed. Additionally, the bioactivity lasted longer in the combination product than in BAG alone. The optimal ratio for bioactive glass and clodronate and optimal particle size for BAG for local treatment of periodontitis was investigated and selected based on bioactivity of the BAG, safest pH profile of the combination product, as well as highest possible amount of clodronate to achieve the enhanced bioactivity for the BAG. The combination product chosen was 1 g BAG with a particle size of 0.5-0.8 mm and 200 mg of clodronate premoisturized with saline.   Finally, the selected combination product was compared to the BAG alone in the treatment of the periodontitis maintenance phase in a pilot study with ten study subjects. Based on the clinical signs and symptoms of inflammation or infection at the site (evaluated by the investigator) and overall satisfaction the combination product is at least as good as bioactive glass alone. Of the two bone remodeling biomarkers (osteoprotegerin and osteocalcin) selected for the study, only osteoprotegerin data indicate that the effect of the novel combination product is beneficial. Osteoprotegerin levels decreased in both combination product and BAG alone treated teeth but less in the combination product treated teeth. However, due to the short time period of investigation as well as the limited number of subjects and treated teeth, the result for bone quality remains only indicative. The positive effect of the combination product on tooth sensitivity may bring additional benefits in comparison to the use of BAG alone in periodontal maintenance therapy." nohref="" />

Ribacka, Camilla

The respiratory chain is found in the inner mitochondrial membrane of higher organisms and in the plasma membrane of many bacteria. It consists of several membrane-spanning enzymes, which conserve the energy that is liberated from the degradation of food molecules as an electrochemical proton gradient across the membrane. The proton gradient can later be utilized by the cell for different energy requiring processes, e.g. ATP production, cellular motion or active transport of ions. The difference in proton concentration between the two sides of the membrane is a result of the translocation of protons by the enzymes of the respiratory chain, from the negatively charged (N-side) to the positively charged side (P-side) of the lipid bilayer, against the proton concentration gradient. The endergonic proton transfer is driven by the flow of electrons through the enzymes of the respiratory chain, from low redox-potential electron donors to acceptors of higher potential, and ultimately to oxygen.   Cytochrome c oxidase is the last enzyme in the respiratory chain and catalyzes the reduction of dioxygen to water. The redox reaction is coupled to proton transport across the membrane by a yet unresolved mechanism. Cytochrome c oxidase has two proton-conducting pathways through which protons are taken up to the interior part of the enzyme from the N-side of the membrane. The K-pathway transfers merely substrate protons, which are consumed in the process of water formation at the catalytic site. The D-pathway transfers both substrate protons and protons that are pumped to the P-side of the membrane.   This thesis focuses on the role of two conserved amino acids in proton translocation by cytochrome c oxidase, glutamate 278 and tryptophan 164. Glu278 is located at the end of the D-pathway and is thought to constitute the branching point for substrate and pumped protons. In this work, it was shown that although Glu278 has an important role in the proton transfer mechanism, its presence is not an obligatory requirement. Alternative structural solutions in the area around Glu278, much like the ones present in some distantly related heme-copper oxidases, could in the absence of Glu278 support the formation of a long hydrogen-bonded water chain through which proton transfer from the D-pathway to the catalytic site is possible.  The other studied amino acid, Trp164, is hydrogen bonded to the "-propionate of heme a3 of the catalytic site. Mutation of this amino acid showed that it may be involved in regulation of proton access to a proton acceptor, a pump site, from which the proton later is expelled to the P-side of the membrane. The ion pair that is formed by the "-propionate of heme a3 and arginine 473 is likely to form a gate-like structure, which regulates proton mobility to the P-side of the membrane. The same gate may also be part of an exit path through which water molecules produced at the catalytically active site are removed towards the external side of the membrane.   Time-resolved optical and electrometrical experiments with the Trp164 to phenylalanine mutant revealed a so far undetected step in the proton pumping mechanism. During the A to PR transition of the catalytic cycle, a proton is transferred from Glu278 to the pump site, located somewhere in the vicinity of the "-propionate of heme a3. A mechanism for proton pumping by cytochrome c oxidase is proposed on the basis of the presented results and the mechanism is discussed in relation to some relevant experimental data. A common proton pumping mechanism for all members of the heme-copper oxidase family is moreover considered." nohref="" />

108
The main objective of this dissertation is to describe the current state and classhood of rhotics in the Minas Gerais variety of Brazilian Portuguese (BP), explore the factors behind sound change, and discuss the direction of change. The hypothesis is that changes in various subsystems of the language contribute to a general sound change trajectory, which takes place mostly through articulatory reduction and retiming in frequently used words and constructions (as predicted by Exemplar Models). Language is seen as a Complex Adaptive System that consists of several subsystems, all of which undergo change and can contribute simultaneously to gradual changes in the overall system.   Semi-structured interviews and a sentence completion task with 14 speakers from southwestern Minas Gerais yielded a total of 7,765 contexts for rhotics. The rhotics of BP were found to include trills, taps, fricatives, approximants and aspirated approximants in alveolar, palatal, retroflex/bunched, uvular, and glottal places of articulation. Deletions also form a considerable part of the data.   BP rhotics have followed two diverging lenition trajectories: one anterior (alveo-palatal) and one posterior (uvular and glottal). Both trajectories can ultimately lead to deletion. Factors that promote lenition include post-tonic position, adjacency to the voiceless fricative [s] and/or the high vowels [i u], and coda position which involves more lenited r-variants and deletion than any other context. Once sound change begins to generalize in these attractors, it can also spread to other r-contexts.   BP rhotics are best modelled as a network of language-specific family relationships, in which chains of articulatory reductions and retimings establish diachronic connections between synchronically distant variants. As a class, rhotics are featurally, articulatorily, and phonetically unspecified, and phonetic overlap between contexts makes the contrast between r-variants incomplete. For this reason, the phonological representation of rhotics consists of fuzzy positional categories that encompass a variety of phonetic forms and that are constantly updated through language use." nohref="" />

Volatile organic compounds (VOC) are emitted into the atmosphere from both biogenic and anthropogenic sources. Some VOCs act as aerosol precursor compounds in the atmosphere, and thus, affect Earth's radiative budget and the global climate.   In this thesis VOC exchange between the surface and the atmosphere was studied in an ecosystem scale using micrometeorological flux measurement techniques combined with proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry for VOC concentration measurements. The measurements were obtained above three different environments: a Scots pine dominated boreal forest, a Mediterranean oak-hornbeam dominated forest, and an urban area. The main results were the following: i) The direct flux measurement technique, disjunct eddy covariance method, was found to be problematic in low-flux conditions, thus, the indirect surface layer profile method can be recommended for flux measurements in these conditions. Conversely, the eddy covariance method with a time-of-flight mass analyser was found to be a powerful tool for VOC flux measurements. ii) The total VOC flux in the boreal ecosystem was dominated by monoterpenes through the whole year, and also oxygenated VOCs made rather a large contribution. Monoterpene emissions depended on both temperature and light. On the other hand, isoprene was the dominant flux compound above the oak-hornbeam forest, while other compounds played only minor roles compared with the isoprene flux. The OVOC exchange was found to be bi-directional, i.e. many OVOCs, especially methanol, had also significant deposition to the surface. A semi-empirical algorithm was developed to determine the total exchange of methanol. iii) The VOC emissions from anthropogenic sources were significant and they could be determined with the disjunct eddy covariance method. The emission dynamics of VOCs was more complicated compared with the forest environments. However, in urban areas traffic was the most important source for many VOCs whereas isoprene originated mostly from urban vegetation.   The methods applied in this study can be used in multiple ecosystems and the thesis provides some recommendations for selecting the most feasible and reliable methods. The results of the thesis, such as determined emission potentials, are also adaptable for modelling purposes.

Tutkielmani aiheena ovat kolttasaamelaiset, jotka ovat Kuolan niemimaan alkuperäiskansaa. Kuolan niemimaan lisäksi heidän perinteinen asuinalueensa käsittää myös Suomen ja Norjan Lapin koillisosat. Vuoden 1920 Tarton rauhassa kolttien asuinalue jakautui kahtia, osan jäädessä silloisen Neuvostoliiton puolelle ja osan Suomen puolelle. Toisen maailmansodan jälkeen, Suomen menetettyä Petsamon alueen, koltat saivat valita kummalle puolelle rajaa he halusivat asettua. Valinta tehtiin pääasiassa vanhojen sukumaiden perusteella. Suomen valinneet koltat sijoitettiin lopulta Inarin kunnan alueelle, Sevettijärven, Nellimin ja Keväjärven kyliin.   Koltat ovat perinteisesti kuuluneet ortodoksiseen kirkkoon, ja tämä tekee heistä uskonnollisen vähemmistön suhteessa enemmistösuomalaisiin, mutta myös suhteessa muihin saamelaisiin. Ortodoksisuus on myös nähty vahvana osana kolttasaamelaisten itäsaamelaista kulttuuriperinnettä, joka näkyy niin pukeutumisessa, käsitöissä, musiikissa, juhlissa kuin ruokakulttuurissakin. Tämä asetelma on toiminut lähtökohtana tutkimukselleni. Pro gradu -työssäni tarkastelen, millainen rooli ortodoksisuudella on kolttasaamelaisten identiteetin muotoutumisessa sekä miten rooli on muotoutunut ja millaisia eroja suhtautumisessa ortodoksikirkkoon on eri kolttasukupolvien välillä.   Saamelaisten uskontoa ja uskonnollisuutta, etenkin uskonnon esikristillistä aikakautta, on tutkittu jo monien vuosikymmenten ajan. Kolttasaamelaisten nykyuskonnollisuuden osuus tästä tutkimuksesta on kuitenkin jäänyt vähemmälle huomiolle, mikä tarkoittaa, että tutkimus on tältä osin paikoin vanhentunutta. Tutkimukseni merkitys nousee juuri tästä vajeesta tutkimushistoriassa, ja tutkimukseni pyrkiikin tarkastelemaan myös viimeisten vuosikymmenten suurten sosiaalisten muutosten vaikutusta kolttasaamelaisten uskonnollisuuteen. Tämän vuoksi tutkielmani nojaa vahvasti uskontososiologisiin teorioihin ja tarjoaa myös tältä osin tuoreehkon näkökulman kolttasaamelaisen uskonnollisuuden tutkimukseen.   Aineistoni koostuu kymmenestä teemahaastattelusta, jotka tein kahdella kenttätyömatkalla vuonna 2013 Inarin kunnan alueella. Suurin osa haastateltavistani oli ortodoksisia kolttasaamelaisia, mutta joukossa oli myös etnisiä suomalaisia. Olen soveltanut aineistooni laadullista sisällönanalyysia. Tarkastellessani aineistoa olen koonnut yhteen, mitä informantit ovat haastatteluteemoista sanoneet. Analyysin temaattinen fokus keskittyy kollektiivisen muistin käsitteen ympärille. Tapa, jolla informantit käsittelivät ortodoksisuutta, muistutti hyvin vahvasti ylisukupolvisen muistin käsitettä, ja täten voikin sanoa, että teoria nousi hyvin luonnollisesti aineiston pohjalta. Analyysiin liittyy vahvasti myös etnisyyden käsite. Kollektiivinen muisti osaltaan vahvistaa etnistä identiteettiä, ja tarkastelenkin tutkimuksessani myös kollektiivisen muistin ja etnisen identiteetin suhdetta ortodoksisuuden näkökulmasta.   Analyysissani ortodoksisuuden rooli kolttasaamelaisten kollektiivisen muistin osana rakentuu seuraavien teemojen pohjalle: symbolit, rituaalit ja narratiivit, paikallisuuden ja kuuluvuuden tunne sekä kolttasaamelaisten monitasoinen vähemmistöasema suhteessa ympäröiviin ryhmittymiin. Läpileikkaavana teemana tutkielmassani on myös sukupolvien välinen kehitys. Tutkielmani osoittaa, kuinka esimerkiksi ortodoksisuuden kollektiivinen muisti linkittyy symboleiden kautta etnisyyteen kahdella tavalla: etniset elementit toisaalta linkittyvät (esimerkiksi kolttasaamelaisten puvun ja kielen käyttö liturgioissa) uskonnolliseen ympäristöön ja toisaalta alkujaan uskonnolliset elementit voivat myös saada vahvoja etnisiä vivahteita (esimerkiksi hautajaisrituaalit ja pyhimystarinat). Paikallisuus ja kuuluvuuden tunne alueeseen   oli se sitten laajemmin koko saamelaisalue tai oma kotikylä - vahvistavat myös osaltaan ortodoksisuuden roolia kolttasaamelaisten kollektiivisessa muistissa. Uskonto koetaan vahvemmin omalla kotialueella, ja toisaalta kolttakylien väliset eroavaisuudet korostavat myös kollektiivisen muistin värikkyyttä. Materiaalini antaa myös viitteitä siitä, että ortodoksisuus voi toimia kolttasaamelaista identiteettiä vahvistavana tekijänä saamelaisalueen ulkopuolella asuville.   Kolttasaamelaisten ainutlaatuinen asema monitasoisena vähemmistöryhmänä heijastuu myös kollektiiviseen muistiin. Koltat ovat vähemmistönä niin ortodoksikirkon sisällä, suhteessa luterilaisiin suomalaisiin, kuin myös suhteessa muihin saamelaisiin. Muiden ryhmien suhtautuminen kolttien ortodoksisuuteen ja toisaalta myös se, miten koltat ovat itse suhtautuneet muihin tahoihin, on vaikuttanut siihen, miten ortodoksisuuden rooli kollektiivisen muistin osana on rakentunut. Tutkielmani myös osoittaa, että suhtautumisessa ortodoksiseen kirkkoon on sukupolvien välisiä eroja. Tähän ovat osaltaan vaikuttaneet ympäröivän yhteiskunnan muutos, modernisaatio ja sekularisaatio, mutta myös kolttasaamelaisten vähemmistöroolin muotoutuminen suhteessa ympäröiviin yhteisöihin." nohref="" />

Habitat loss and fragmentation is the main culprit behind the current decline in biodiversity. The estimated current rate of extinction is two or three orders of magnitude higher than the background extinction rate. This thesis analyzes existing data and develops models to improve our understanding of the role of spatial processes in the dynamics of populations and communities. This work is focused on the features of habitat destruction that causes decline of biodiversity as well as the traits that make species vulnerable to habitat loss.   First, I attempt to infer relationships between spatial heterogeneity, rate of diversification (speciation and extinction), and the dynamics of geographical ranges from a reconstructed phylogeny. I build a flexible comparative method to analyze adaptive radiation and range dynamics that extends the current models in two directions by allowing more than two regions and by assuming diversity-dependent diversification rates. In a five-region system stimulated by the biogeography of Madagascar, processes that increase and decrease diversity are strongly correlated. Therefore, it is not possible to estimate independently region-specific speciation and extinction rates, though their ratios can be successfully estimated. When applied to Malagasy dung beetles, we found that diversification rate is highest in the northern (very heterogeneous) and lowest in the southern (most homogeneous) parts of Madagascar. Thus it appears that landscape heterogeneity promotes diversification and thus biodiversity.   The two other chapters investigate the consequences of habitat loss and fragmentation for generalist and specialist species. We aim to understand how generalist and specialist species respond to habitat loss and fragmentation. In particular, we ask why generalist species often increase in abundance following an intermediate level of habitat destruction. I develop a modular modeling approach that allows one to switch on and off various mechanisms as needed. This approach one to assess the marginal and joint effects of different mechanisms by comparing model outcomes. Our analyses confirm that a high level of specialization leads to high sensitivity to habitat loss and fragmentation. When landscape quality is high, specialists are competitively superior, but when landscape degrades, generalists gradually become superior. In previous models, competitive hierarchy is usually thought to be an intrinsic property of species, but we show that a shift in competitive capacity is caused by extrinsic factors. Comparing deterministic versus stochastic models, we find that a key extrinsic factor is increase in demographic stochasticity in degraded landscapes that affects specialists more than generalists.   In the third chapter, I ask about the role of large- scale habitat corridor for biodiversity conservation. We analyzed a community of 300 species belonging to 6 taxonomic groups inhabiting more than 2000 km2 forest, composed of two large national parks in Madagascar, Ranomafana and Andringitra, and connected by a corridor. We found that in 2000 the corridor was still functional, but since then it has degraded substantially and may lose its corridor function in the coming decades. Our spatially realistic simulations show that species with passive mode of dispersal suffer the most from corridor destruction.   This thesis emphasizes the role of different mechanisms that should be considered while analyzing species  responses to changes in habitat structure. The most important ones are the mode of dispersal, ecological specialization, temporal and spatial stochasticity, and competition. As such, tropical regions, like Madagascar, are in double trouble due to high ecological specialization of most species and high rates of habitat destruction. Effective measures need to be enforced to ameliorate the conditions within and outside protected areas so they can truly enhance biodiversity protection." nohref="" />

Pyyry, Noora

In this thesis, the key themes of 1) knowing and 2) participation are examined in relation to creative and meaningful practical engagement with one's everyday surroundings, i.e.  'dwelling with'  the world. These themes are explored both within the research process and in the context of young people's, and particularly teenage girls' hanging out. This research is inspired by the Situationist practice of dérive, and draws from participatory research tradition, posthuman feminist thinking and non-representational theorization.  'Dwelling with'  is approached with an acknowledgement of the capacity of the material world to produce effects in human bodies: things and spaces thus take part in the - seemingly trivial, but often highly affectual - everyday encounters that make dwelling with possible. Ergo, also 'data' is approached in a new way. The power of words and other representations is not ignored, but they are taken as 'doings': they are performative. Representations are thus not evidence of a separate reality that lies behind them. In the thesis, attention is placed on the creative potential of experimentation.   Fieldwork for this thesis happened in three phases. The first phase in 2011 was a pilot study conducted in Helsinki in connection to a 9th grade geography course (participants were 15 to 16 years). The second phase took place in San Francisco in 2012 and was conducted via school, but separately from schoolwork. The participants in this study we 7th graders (12 to 13 years). The third phase in 2013 took place in Helsinki, again as part of a 9th grade geography course (participants were 15 to 16 years).   First, the thesis explores how participatory methods can be used to support young people's role as co-researchers, foster their engagement in the research process and carve space for alternative knowledges. Together with the playful topic of hanging out, these methods can cultivate a relaxed atmosphere in the research situations. This is especially important when working in the school context. The methods also help balance power relations and address topics that could otherwise be left unnoticed.   Second, the thesis shows how photography can be used as a method for multisensory 'thinking with'  the world. This creative method is connected to movement in photo-walks. This practice is argued to foster young people's engagement with their everyday surroundings, and the research process, by linking action and understanding. This engagement opens up possibilities for spatial-embodied reflection. Later, the photographs serve as fieldnotes that take part in the thinking process and inspire action in the form of reflection in photo-talks. In this thesis, photographs are not considered as data of  'what was there' , rather they are understood to have productive power in the research process.   Third, the thesis introduces the concept of hanging out -knowing. This knowing becomes possible through dwelling with: it takes place in everyday encounters. Hanging out -knowing is non-instrumental multisensory reflection about one's place in the world. Because hanging out is playful and wonderfully purposeless, space is cleared for the inspiring experience of enchantment. In these moments of being moved by something, new reflection can emerge. The moment of enchantment is always accidental, but it can be cultivated by artistic methods, such as photo-walking.   Finally, the thesis argues that by hanging out at a shopping mall teenage girls participate in the world. Because hanging out lacks rigid plans, moments of enchantment become possible. This openness towards the world fosters dwelling with one's surroundings, in this case the shopping mall. By hanging out, girls disturb the rhythm of consumption. Improvisation with things and spaces produces a micro-atmosphere of play that interferes with the atmosphere of consumption at the mall. Through participation by being and by actively marking and claiming spaces as theirs, girls create momentary  'hangout homes'  for themselves. Hanging out produces alternative modes of engagement with the city. Creative experimentation cultivates lively and mixed-use public spaces, and adds to making urban life vibrant and thought-provoking." nohref="" />

The purpose of this dissertation was to examine the role that adult students  achievement goal orientations play in their perceptions of their learning environment (course evaluations) and performance. Accordingly a learning environment questionnaire was developed, students  goal orientation profiles and their stability were examined, and associations between goal orientations, course-specific goals, and course evaluations and performance were looked at.   The samples came from the National Defence University. Study I consisted of two substudies. Substudy 1 (N=194) focused on the development of the learning environment questionnaire, while Substudy 2 (N=167) examined whether students  course evaluations varied as a function of their goal orientation profiles. In Study II (N=169), the stability and change in goal orientations and their relations to course evaluations were examined. Study III (N=88) looked at the predictive relations between students  achievement goal orientations, course evaluations and performance. Study IV (N=88) examined how students  achievement goal orientation and self-reported course-specific goals were related to each other, and how they predicted the students  course evaluations and performance.   Following the person-centred approach, the students were grouped based on their goal orientation profiles. The mastery-oriented students were focused on learning and understanding. The success-oriented students strived toward learning, and absolute and relative success. The performance-oriented students emphasized success but also had concerns about social comparison. The indifferent students displayed little emphasis on any goals. The avoidance-oriented students were focused on minimizing effort, as well as avoiding challenges and failure. The goal orientation profiles were stable: 60% of students retained the same goal orientation profile over time.   The students  course evaluations varied as a function of their goal orientation profiles. Mastery- and performance- or success-oriented students were most positive in their evaluations when compared to avoidance-oriented or indifferent students. As well, slight differences were observed concerning literature-examination scores: the performance-oriented students scored the highest. In sum, the emphasis on learning and absolute success seems adaptive, whereas an emphasis on avoidance seems maladaptive. With regard to predictive relationships, the students  motivational orientations were linked to their course evaluations and achievement, achievement was related to course evaluations, and different pedagogical practices accounted for some of the variation in these relationships. Regarding course-specific goals, by far most frequently, the students  open answers included responses displaying goals of gaining career qualifications as well as mastery-intrinsic goals. The presences of mastery-intrinsic and mastery-extrinsic goals were associated with higher course evaluations, whereas the presence of work-avoidance goals was associated with lower course evaluations. However, the course-specific goals were only weakly related to the goal orientation profiles.   All in all, the results show the common motivational profiles being displayed in a selective adult-student sample, and that these profiles are related to students  perceptions of their learning environment and their own role in relation to it. Further, the results concerning the stability support the conceptualization of goal orientation as motivational disposition. The results concerning students  open-ended answers show that not all goal orientation dimensions were present, or present at equal frequency, and that the students also described their purposes in more instrumental terms. Despite being quite independent from goal orientation profiles, these course-specific goals were very similarly related to the course evaluations.   Based on these findings, instructors need to be aware of both the personal and contextual factors affecting students  interpretations of teaching, as these interpretations may further influence motivation and learning. Students are not a homogenous group in their purposes and approaches as regards learning and studying, and these differing emphases lead to distinct preferences for and interpretations of the various aspects of the learning environment." nohref="" />

A novel method for functional lung imaging was introduced by adapting the K-edge subtraction method (KES) to in vivo studies of small animals. In this method two synchrotron radiation energies, which bracket the K-edge of the contrast agent, are used for simultaneous recording of absorption-contrast images. Stable xenon gas is used as the contrast agent, and imaging is performed in projection or computed tomography (CT) mode. Subtraction of the two images yields the distribution of xenon, while removing practically all features due to other structures, and the xenon density can be calculated quantitatively. Because the images are recorded simultaneously, there are no movement artifacts in the subtraction image. Time resolution for a series of CT images is one image/s, which allows functional studies. Voxel size is 0.1mm3, which is an order better than in traditional lung imaging methods.   KES imaging technique was used in studies of ventilation distribution and the effects of histamine-induced airway narrowing in healthy, mechanically ventilated, and anaesthetized rabbits. First, the effect of tidal volume on ventilation was studied, and the results show that an increase in tidal volume without an increase in minute ventilation results a proportional increase in regional ventilation. Second, spiral CT was used to quantify the airspace volumes in lungs in normal conditions and after histamine aerosol inhalation, and the results showed large patchy filling defects in peripheral lungs following histamine provocation. Third, the kinetics of proximal and distal airway response to histamine aerosol were examined, and the findings show that the distal airways react immediately to histamine and start to recover, while the reaction and the recovery in proximal airways is slower. Fourth, the fractal dimensions of lungs was studied, and it was found that the fractal dimension is higher at the apical part of the lungs compared to the basal part, indicating structural differences between apical and basal lung level.   These results provide new insights to lung function and the effects of drug challenge studies. Nowadays the technique is available at synchrotron radiation facilities, but the compact synchrotron radiation sources are being developed, and in relatively near future the method may be used at hospitals." nohref="" />

Refashioning the Respectable Elite Woman in Louis XIV's Paris: Madame de Sévigné and Ninon de Lenclos   This PhD thesis is an analysis of the appearances, material culture and sexuality of the respectable woman, l honneste femme, in Paris under the regime of Louis XIV. Through the examples of Madame de Sévigné and Ninon de Lenclos, the study describes how Parisian elite women were able to fashion the ideal of l honneste femme and how reality and ideals were combined in Parisian society. The study is based on the idea that female chastity is not the only key factor when evaluating and refashioning l honneste femme and the 17th-century female ideal was composed from different elements: elite status, education, manners, material culture, outer appearance and sexuality; residential area also played a role, especially the quartier of Le Marais with its flourishing elite culture. The study shows that l honneste femme was the result of the mastering of all these different layers of elite living. In addition, it notes that the respectable Parisian elite woman could make her own decisions in relation to her lifestyle and self-fashioning. These actions were essential when constructing the entity of l honneste femme.   The aim of the study is to answer the following questions: How did Madame de Sévigné and Ninon de Lenclos reflect the ideal of the elite culture? How was the notion of a respectable woman constructed? Was this a matter of perfect abstinence as previous scholars claim or was it rather a performance that required different elements to be fulfilled? If so, what were the essential aspects when refashioning the respectable woman? How did Madame de Sévigné and Ninon de Lenclos fashion themselves? Did their self-fashioning aim to perform as honnestes femmes or did they search for other ways to be part of the society of les honnêtes gens? Most importantly, the study considers why both Marquise de Sévigné and Ninon de Lenclos were considered honnestes femmes at the end of their lives?   The study, qualitative in nature, is based on a variety of sources. By means of critical close reading the study analyses the letters of Madame de Sévigné and Ninon de Lenclos and their inventaires après décès which are key sources. The valuable information these post-mortem inventories offer has not been used properly ever before in studies on l honneste femme. Another prominent source for the study are the Mémoires composed by the contemporaries of Madame de Sévigné and Ninon de Lenclos. Seventeenth-century conduct books such as François de Grenaille s L Honnête fille (1640); Jacques Du Bosc s L Honneste femme (1632); Antoine de Courtin s Nouveau Traité de la civilité qui se pratique en France parmi les honnêtes gens (1671); François de Sales  Introduction à la vie devote (1641) and Nicolas Venette s Tableau de l'amour conjugal (1686) help to understand the female ideal like on the theoretical level. Both Madame de Sévigné and Ninon de Lenclos were immortalised in several portraits that were reflections of the honnête status. Thus, such visual sources as portraits and gravures have also been analysed and combined with the overall source material and research literature.   The most important notion is that even if the ideal of the elite woman, l honneste femme, had been created mostly by male authors, it was adjustable and adaptable. Furthermore, the study argues that the external signs of l honneste femme played a greater role than previous scholars have assumed. In other words, l honneste femme and her honnête performance were created from many different social and personal aspects of which chastity was only one of them. Thus, the study shows how 17th-century Parisian elite women had to be able to uphold simultaneously different status layers of their rank to fulfil the expectations the Ancien Régime created for l honneste femme.   Key words: l honneste femme, honnêteté, sexuality, material culture, self-fashioning, Paris, seventeenth-century." nohref="" />

Lignans are naturally occurring compounds, polyphenolic secondary plant and mammalian metabolites. Due to their ubiquitous presence and biological activity, lignans have attracted the interest of scientists from different areas, like nutrition scientists, pharmaceutical researchers and synthetic chemists. The research is very active, and the number of lignan related publications has proliferated.  Lignans vary widely in the structure, and the present work focuses mainly on the (hydroxy)lignano-­9,9 ­ lactones, their rearranged products, and 9,9 -­epoxylignanes. The literature review introduces the stereochemistry and assignment of the absolute configuration of these lignans. In addition, stable isotope labelling of lignans is reviewed.  The experimental part is focused on deuteration of lignans and rearrangement and stereochemistry studies. The deuteration reaction utilising acidic H/D exchange within the lignan skeleton was investigated. The relative reactivity of various aromatic sites, the stability of deuterium labels and the isotopic purity of the labelled compounds were examined. Experimental observations and results were compared to computational studies. Several stable, isotopically pure polydeuterated lignano-­9,9 -lactones and 9,9 -­epoxylignanes were synthesised. Alongside the deuteration experiments unexpected reactivity in eletrophilic aromatic deuteration of methylenedioxy substituted compounds was observed and further studied.  In addition to deuteration, the stereochemistry of certain rearranged lignanolactones was a central subject of this study. Our findings allowed to clarify some mechanistical aspects of the rearrangement reactions of 7 -­hydroxylignano-­9,9 -­lactones and revise certain disputable structural data in the literature. Furthermore, the X-­ray structures of 7 -hydroxylignano-­9,9 -­lactones and rearranged 9 -hydroxylignano-­9,7 -­lactones were obtained for the first time." nohref="" />

Pesonen, Henri

Sense of belonging has been defined as the degree to which an individual feels included, accepted, and supported by others in a variety of social settings, for example, a school context. Previous research on sense of belonging has mainly focused on students with special needs in inclusive schools. There appears to be a shortage of research on sense of belonging in different school placements (general and special) and in post-school life for individuals with intensive special education needs.   The purpose of this thesis, which consists of three related, internationally published peer-reviewed articles (Studies I-III), was to examine to what extent sense of belonging can be supported in school and in post-school life for students with intensive special education needs in Finland. Particular focus was placed on the voices of those students in order to understand how best to create a positive school climate that supports sense of belonging for all. Teacher perceptions of the implemented three-tiered support model (Finland' s Basic Education Act 642/2010) and school visit data were utilized to contextualize the students  conceptions and experiences.   Study I examined conceptions associated with sense of belonging in general and special school placements for middle-school students with intensive special education needs (N = 5). Phenomenographic methods of analysis were utilized in Study I. In Study II, which was based on the narratives of two females (ages 26 and 29) with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), the focus was on sense of belonging and various life transition issues that may appear in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood in the absence of appropriate social supports. Qualitative narrative approaches were used in Study II to analyze interview and document data in order to create life transition stories. Study III examined the implementation of new, special education legislation in Finland (Basic Education Act 642/2010) among students with intensive special education needs. The material for Study III consisted of (1) survey data on teacher perceptions (N = 526) of the implementation of the education legislation and the current organization of special education services, and (2) observations of the implementation of the legislation in schools (N = 12) across Finland. The analysis of the survey data in Study III was based on sequential mixed-methods design. The school observation data were analyzed qualitatively.   In Study I, the qualitative phenomenographic analyses of interview transcripts revealed various conceptions regarding the students  sense of belonging in different school placements (general and special). The students had undergone numerous placements in which their sense of belonging had been jeopardized, as disturbing relationships with teachers and peers seemed to have affected the students  mental and physical well-being, resulting in disturbing behaviors in their earlier educational settings. Despite the various placements, the students felt  better  in their current, special, school, which had a positive climate. The results of Study II demonstrated that lack of social support increases the number of school placements and transitions and causes biases in forming a sense of belonging. The findings further suggested that providing social assistance and positive life experiences during emerging adulthood (ages 18-25) seems to matter most in forming a strong sense of belonging in life. Furthermore, the findings of both Studies I and II suggested that, for individuals with intensive special education needs, adapting one s behavior in order to feel a sense of belonging (Juvonen, 2006) might be associated with hiding the unique characteristics of a person s special needs. Study III found that teachers  values and beliefs seem to influence the organization of special education (e.g., affecting the overall school climate). Furthermore, some schools and teachers implemented the law s integration requirement by placing all students with intensive special needs in separate units or school buildings, whereas other schools placed students in general education.   The findings suggest that students with intensive special education needs can feel a sense of belonging primarily in schools in which adults work in multidisciplinary collaboration, which helps to create an accepting and supportive school climate. In the post-school phase, it appeared that positive experiences during emerging adulthood (between the ages of 18 and 25) seem to matter most in generating a strong sense of belonging to a community. Hence, individuals with intensive special needs would benefit from ongoing support from the time they first enter school with continuation through the post-school transition phase and into adulthood. Also, the results hypothetically imply that the school principal plays a significant role in creating a school climate that supports a sense of belonging for all students. The results of this thesis also shed light on several limitations that prevent generalizations from being made. Therefore, further study is unquestionably needed. This thesis has provided an initial exploration into the under-researched area of sense of belonging in different school placements and in post-school life for students with intensive special education needs.    Keywords: sense of belonging, intensive special education needs, school placement, transition, teachers  values and beliefs, school climate" nohref="" />

This thesis concerns questions motivated by two-dimensional critical lattice models of statistical mechanics, and conformal field theory (CFT). The core idea is to apply algebraic techniques to solve questions in random geometry, and reveal the algebraic structures therein. We consider the interplay between braided Hopf algebras (quantum groups) and CFT, with applications to critical lattice models and conformally invariant random curves, Schramm-Loewner evolutions (SLE).  In the first article, a quantum group method is developed to construct explicit expressions for CFT correlation functions using a hidden Uq(sl2) symmetry. The quantum group method provides tools to directly read off properties of the functions from representation theoretical data. The correlation functions are analytic functions of several complex variables satisfying linear homogeneous partial differential equations known as the Benoit & Saint-Aubin PDEs. Such PDEs emerge in CFT from singular vectors in representations of the Virasoro algebra. The correlation functions of conformal field theory are believed to describe scaling limits of correlations in critical lattice models, expected to exhibit conformal invariance in the scaling limit.   The second article contains applications to questions in the theory of SLEs: the pure partition functions of multiple SLEs, and the chordal SLE boundary visit probability amplitudes, also known as Green s functions. The relevant solutions to the PDEs are found by imposing certain natural boundary conditions given by specified asymptotic behavior. Loosely speaking, the appropriate boundary conditions can be deduced from the qualitative properties of the associated stochastic processes, or alternatively, by CFT fusion arguments. More general solutions to the PDEs are constructed in the fourth article, in the spirit of fusion of CFT.   The above type of solutions emerge also from critical lattice models, as (conjectured) scaling limits of renormalized probabilities of crossing and boundary visit events of interfaces. In the third article, such questions for the loop-erased random walk and the uniform spanning tree are studied. Explicit formulas for the probabilities are found, and their convergence in the scaling limit to solutions of second and third order PDEs of Benoit & Saint-Aubin type is proved. Furthermore, these functions are related to the conformal blocks of CFT, by certain combinatorial structures." nohref="" />

As the consumption of natural resources increase with the exponential world population growth, the food industry needs to answer the demand. This means that farming has to be increased and optimized from its current level. The problem is summoned from the fact that the amount of arable land is decreasing. This eventually leads to prioritizing the land for food crops and the downscaling the production of i.e. palm oil and cotton. Cotton is ~90% pure cellulose and is used for textile commodities for its properties over synthetic fibers. The same cellulose can be found all around in nature, from the structure of trees to algae. Cellulose is the world s most commonly found polymer and it is generated annually in nature enough to stop cotton farming altogether. The problem is the low solubility of cellulose to commonly used solvents. The extensive hydrogen bonding network of cellulose gives this biopolymer its strong features. The structure of cellulose and the chemical features has been known for a century and a half to this date, but solubilization of cellulose has evaded a more systemic, yet pragmatic approach. There have been introductions of various types of solvent systems for cellulose dissolution, from which ionic liquids have been the most successful class of solvents. The research performed in this thesis has been focusing on the research and development of new cellulose dissolving ionic liquids. A class of imidazolium based ionic liquids was used as the starting point for the development, since they exhibit high dissolutive power and relatively low viscosities. The chemical stability of the solvent system needs to sustain various kinds of chemical and physical stress without compromising process safety, ecology or economy. Our research indicated that the acidity-basicity of the ionic liquid components was correlating with the chemical-physical stability of the solvents. The higher the basicity was the less stable the ionic liquid become and in the same time it was found out that the ionic liquids that were synthesized from less basic components were not able to dissolve cellulose in the first place. We calculated the gas-phase basicities (proton affinity) of various types and strengths of bases by using simple and efficient computational method. After the calculations were done, we combined the bases with acetic acid to form acetate ionic liquids and with propionic acid for propionates correspondingly. After the examination of the cellulose dissolution capability we discovered a threshold basicity where the cellulose dissolution capability was introduced. In a collaboration with Aalto University, we developed an ionic liquid that could be used in industrial scale production of cellulose fibers. The research was steered towards investigation of the chemical stability and recyclability of this new ionic liquid." nohref="" />

Recently, there has been a lot of interest to computationally study ice and icelike systems. Simulating such structures, using ab initio methods require atomic level models. However, creating adequate models for ice is challenging, as there are a huge number of isomers for any ice formation. Two factors contribute to the number of isomers: (i) the positions of oxygens that give rise to various crystal structures, and (ii) the possibilities for hydrogen atom positions for each crystal structure. The second factor means that many nearly degenerate ``proton configurations'' exist for ice. Consequently, large entropy can be observed for ice at normal temperatures. However, because of the large energetic barriers between different proton configurations, 'residual' entropy can be measured even at 0 K.   In this thesis, the proton configurational disorder in ice and icelike systems is studied computationally using ab initio methods. In addition, a computer program is developed to aid in the generation and analysis of proton configurations. The systems discussed in the four articles of this thesis are the normal ice (ice Ih), protonated and neutral ice clusters, and icelike systems on surfaces.   In the case of ice Ih, the ordering to the lowest energy configuration (ice XI) and the claimed ferroelectricity of this configuration are studied using ice films with and without natrium hydroxide dopants. Calculations with ice films on platinum surfaces were also performed. According to my results, ice XI is not ferroelectric, although NaOH and the Pt(111) substrate are observed to cause some ordering.   In the context of ice clusters, phenomena behind the abundance of the 'magic number clusters', observed in experiments, are studied. The results indicate that the protonated cluster energetics are dominated by the local geometry of the H9O4+ Eigen complex, which prefers a near-planar orientation. In addition, the number of hydrogen bonds in a cluster is seen to affect the energetics. However, a proton configurational analysis indicates that the cluster energetics are also affected by the entropy caused by the number of proton configurations. The icelike systems containing less than four-fold coordinated water molecules are studied, and relationships are established between 'hydrogen bond connectivity parameters' and proton configuration energetics." nohref="" />

Palmerio, Erika

Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) often travel in the interplanetary space faster than the ambient solar wind. When their relative velocities exceed the local magnetosonic speed, a shock wave forms. The region between the shock front and the leading edge is known as a sheath region. Sheaths are compressed regions characterized by turbulent magnetic field and plasma properties and they can cause significant space weather disturbances.  Within the sheath region, it is possible to find fine structures such as planar magnetic structures (PMSs). The magnetic field vectors in a PMS are characterized by abrupt changes in direction and magnitude, but they all remain for a time interval of several hours nearly parallel to a single plane that includes the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) spiral direction.  PMSs have been associated to several regions and phenomena in the heliosphere, but many of them occur in CME sheath regions. This suggests that CMEs play a central role in the formation of PMSs, probably by provoking the amplification and the alignment of pre-existing discontinuities by compression of the solar wind at the CME-driven shock or because of the draping of the magnetic field lines around the CME ejecta. The presence of PMSs in sheath regions, moreover, suggests that PMSs themselves can be related to space weather effects at Earth, therefore a comprehensive study of PMS formation and structure might lead to a better knowledge of the geoeffectiveness of CMEs.  This work presents the study of PMSs in the sheath region of CMEs with a magnetic cloud (MC) structure for a sample of events observed in situ by the ACE and WIND spacecraft between 1997 and 2013. The presence of fine structures is evaluated through the minimum variance analysis (MVA) method, needed for determining the normal vector to the PMS-plane. Then, the position of each PMS within its corresponding sheath region is determined and the encountered cases are divided into different groups. Eventually, a number of shock, sheath and MC properties is evaluated for each group, aiming to perform a statistical analysis.  The conclusions are that PMSs are observed in 80% of the studied sheath events and their average duration is "<5 hours. PMSs tend to form in certain locations within the sheath: they are generally observed close to the CME-driven shock, close to the MC leading edge or they span the whole sheath. PMSs observed near the shock can be associated to strong shocks, while PMSs located near the MC leading edge can be related to high density regions and, therefore, to compression." nohref="" />

It is often assumed that unemployment increases the probability of armed conflicts, riots and political instability in general. However, there is a considerable shortage of empirical research on this topic and generally the evidence available does not confirm the positive linkage between unemployment and political instability. Many have considered unemployment to be an important factor also behind the so-called Arab Spring. This thesis aims to analyse more closely what role unemployment played in the spark of these uprisings. From a theoretical viewpoint, relative deprivation theory and opportunity-cost approach can link unemployment to political instability. On the other hand several factors, stigmatisation and lack of collective resources, for example, are theorised to hinder the mobilisation of the unemployed.  The approach of this thesis is quantitative and its principal method is regression analysis. Most of the analyses are conducted using existent and extensive survey data sets, most notably the third wave of the Arab Barometer released in late 2014. In addition, the thesis explores descriptively data about the trends and patterns of the unemployment rates, protests, and organised violence. The study area of the thesis covers those Arab countries, where this data is available. Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, and Yemen are studied more closely.  The key finding of the thesis is that an unemployed respondent has not taken part in the protests of the Arab Spring more likely than an employed respondent. Several alternative operationalisations confirm this finding. Survey data also suggest that unemployed people are less satisfied with their lives and politically less active compared to the employed. Further, satisfaction with life does not affect an individual's likelihood of protest attendance, but a higher interest in politics is a strong predictor of protest participation. As it seems that dissatisfaction does not turn to protesting, this might explain the low participation of the unemployed. This thesis finds scantly support that a higher unemployment rate would lead to a higher number of protests or a higher level of organised violence in the North African Arab countries.  These results do not inevitably signify that unemployment was an irrelevant factor in the eruption of the Arab Spring uprisings. However, results suggest that unemployment was not a major driving force behind the Arab Spring. More generally, the outcome of this thesis together with earlier empirical research around the world suggests, that unemployment does not increase the likelihood of political instability as forcefully as it is often proposed." nohref="" />

Oksanen, Mika

My dissertation deals with metaontology or metametaphysics. This is the subdiscipline of philosophy that is concerned with the investigation of metaphysical concepts, statements, theories and problems on the metalevel. It analyses the meaning of metaphysical statements and theories and discusses how they are to be justified. The name "metaontology" is recently coined, but the task of metaontology is the same as Immanuel Kant already dealt with in his Critique of Pure Reason. As methods I use both historical research and logical (or rather semantical) analysis. In order to understand clearly what metaphysical terms or theories mean or should mean we must both look at how they have been characterized in the course of the history of philosophy and then analyse the meanings that have historically been given to them with the methods of modern formal semantics. Metaontological research would be worthless if it could not in the end be applied to solving some substantive ontological questions. In the end of my dissertation, therefore, I give arguments for a solution to the substantively ontological problem of universals, a form of realism about universals called promiscuous realism. To prepare the way for that argument, I argue that the metaontological considerations most relevant to the problem of universals are considerations concerning ontological commitment, as the American philosophers Quine and van Inwagen have argued, not those concerning truthmakers as such philosophers as the Australian realist D. M. Armstrong have argued or those concerning verification conditions as such philosophers as Michael Dummett have argued. To justify this conclusion, I go first through well-known objections to verificationism, and show that they apply also to current verificationist theories such as Dummett's theory and Field's deflationist theory of truth. In the process I also respond to opponents of metaphysics who try to show with the aid of verificationism or structuralism that metaphysical questions would be meaningless or illegitimate in some other way. Having justified the central role of ontological commitment, I try to develop a detailed theory of it. The core of my work is a rigorous formal development of a theory of ontological commitment. I construct it by combining Alonzo Church's theory of ontological commitment with Tarski's theory of truth." nohref="" />

Modern DNA sequencing technologies have opened up new possibilities to study bacteria. These methods have not only enabled the characterization of the genetic capacities of bacteria at previously unseen scale but have also provided a wealth of information about bacterial transcriptomes. In this thesis, sequencing and subsequent analysis approaches were applied to study Lactobacillus crispatus and Propionibacterium freudenreichii. Specifically, the aim was to uncover how these two Gram-positive species of human relevance can live in and interact with their environments.   L. crispatus is a prominent member of the human vaginal flora and important for urogenital health. In this thesis, an annotated genome sequence was produced for L. crispatus ST1 and analyzed in conjunction with publicly available genome sequences of nine vaginal L. crispatus isolates. The common ortholog groups of the ten isolates captured approximately 57% of the ortholog groups of each isolate and provided a good estimation of the final set of core features of this central urogenital species. Notably, several of the detected L. crispatus core features were of putative relevance to vaginal health. Among these features was a previously characterized adhesin, which was in this thesis identified as a likely antagonist to the harmful vaginal bacterium Gardnerella vaginalis. Altogether, the study revealed a notable functional similarity between the L. crispatus strains and established the role of L. crispatus core proteins in maintaining vaginal health.   P. freudenreichii, in turn, is an industrially important dairy culture. In this thesis, the cheese starter P. freudenreichii ssp. shermanii JS was subjected to transcriptome and genome sequencing to gain a deeper understanding of the role of this bacterium in industrial cheese ripening. The genome of strain JS encoded several enzymes and metabolic pathways involved in the formation of flavor compounds and was highly similar to those of the other P. freudenreichii strains. Transcriptome analysis of industrial cheese samples revealed nearly 15% of the 2,377 protein-coding genes of strain JS to be significantly differentially expressed between the warm and cold room ripening of cheese. Several of the flavor-associated genes exhibited higher expression levels in the warm compared to the cold room samples, corroborating the hypothesis that P. freudenreichii contributes more to the cheese flavor development during warm than cold room ripening.   Automated function prediction of bacterial protein sequences greatly facilitated the genomics investigations of L. crispatus and P. freudenreichii in this thesis, providing functional descriptions for a majority of the predicted coding sequences of strains ST1 and JS. Moreover, re-annotation of the coding sequences of the nine publicly available vaginal L. crispatus isolates significantly increased the portion of the L. crispatus coding sequences with functional descriptions in the comparative genomics study of L. crispatus. The different methods varied in their prediction capabilities and were often complementary, supporting the use of more than one function prediction method in a bacterial genome project. Moreover, extremely strict thresholds in the homology searches were noted to unnecessarily restrict the pool of hits available for annotation transfer, hampering both the annotation quality and the fraction of coding sequences with a functional classification.   Taken together, the utilized sequencing approaches coupled with suitable downstream analyses proved effective in deciphering the physiology of lactobacilli and propionibacteria and offered novel insights into the health-promoting properties of L. crispatus and flavor-forming capabilities of P. freudenreichii." nohref="" />

Most people have the capacity for music perception and production, but the degree of music competency varies between individuals. In this thesis, I studied abilities to identify pitch, tone duration and sound patterns with Karma s test for auditory structuring (KMT), and Seashore s tests for time (ST) and pitch (SP). These abilities can be considered as basic components of musicality. Additionally, I studied self-reported musical activities, especially composing and arranging. Musical ability is a diverse phenotype that includes both acquired and innate abilities. Earlier studies have shown that genetic component affects musical traits; here, heritability was estimated as 21-68%.   Genetic predisposition of musical abilities was studied in family material (N=915) using linkage and linkage disequilibrium analyses. The best association for musical aptitude (KMT, SP and ST) was obtained at 3q21.3 near GATA2 and the best linkage at 4p14 adjacent to PCDH7. For musically experienced individuals without creative activity in music, linkage was found at 18q21. Interestingly, regions near 4q22.1 and 16p12.3 were linked with multiple musical traits. The genes within the resulting regions showed enrichment of inner ear development, schizophrenia and the long-term depression pathway, which is a molecular pathway important in learning and memory.   Using three selection signature methods, FST, haploPS and XP-EHH, over 100 candidate genomic regions were detected to be under positive selection in individuals with high music test scores in the music tests. Enrichment analysis pointed to the development of the inner ear, corresponding to the enrichment results from the musical aptitude linkage analysis, even though there were no common regions between these two studies.   The fourth part of this thesis integrates our musical ability gene mapping results with other music-related studies, including also animal model studies. A convergent genomics approach ranked EGR1, cortisol, FOS and FOXP2 as the most prominent molecules that affect musical abilities. The best 40 genes showed enrichment of cognition. Previous studies have shown that musical abilities share a common background with cognitive abilities, such as intelligence, and this study is the first to suggest the associated molecules.   In conclusion, with these studies, I suggest many new genes and pathways to be associated with musical traits. The genetic predisposition for music is affected by a large number of genes of which only a few have been identified. Musical abilities were linked to multiple different chromosomes of which the 4q22 region is especially interesting. We made a literary survey combining information of molecules related to musical traits that can be used to evaluate genomics results in the future." nohref="" />

Due to the emergence of multidrug resistant bacteria, bacterial infections are still a major healthcare problem. Many factors have led to a discovery void of new antibacterial agents, rendering the current antibiotic pipeline inadequate for future medical needs. For example, the outcomes from pure biochemical high-throughput screening (HTS) assays have, in many cases, not led to successful clinical compounds. Therefore cell-based assays might be a better choice for primary screening. However, the antibacterial cell-based assays in the current use often require long incubation times and they are not always amenable for miniaturization and automation for HTS.   In this work, two screening assays based on recombinant bioluminescent E. coli strains were optimized and implemented in the screening of chemical libraries and natural products in antibacterial drug discovery. One of the recombinant bacterial strains was a strain which is sensitive towards transcriptional and translational inhibitors. The assay based on this strain was successfully miniaturized into 384-format using automatized liquid handling and was validated with a proof-of-concept library containing known drugs. This provided a means to perform a larger scale high throughput screen of a compound library. Based on the HTS hit structures, a ligand-based in silico screening of a virtual chemical library was employed for hit enrichment. The most active hits and the in silico selected compounds were further investigated in more detail. Natural products have been an important source in drug discovery, especially in the discovery of antibiotics in the current use. However, matrix effects such as colour or turbidity of natural product extracts can potentially cause interference in conventional absorbance based microbial growth inhibition assays. Also, conventional antibacterial assays are usually not sensitive enough for detecting very small concentrations in fractionated natural product extracts. The feasibility of bioreporter -based assays in antimicrobial screening of natural products was demonstrated by screening an in-house natural product library. One of the assays was also implemented for investigating the antibacterial properties of an extract from a fungal culture filtrate, which demonstrated the sensitivity of the assay for identification of active components from fractionated samples.   In conclusion, sensitive and reproducible bioassays amenable for further miniaturization and automation were developed for antibacterial drug discovery. Compared to conventional antimicrobial testing, the bioreporter-based methods offer important improvements such as simultaneous data acquirement on antimicrobial activity, first indication of mode of action and significant reduction of assay time to 2-4 h compared to 24 h in standard susceptibility assays. The developed bioluminescent assays led to the improvement of compound throughput in antimicrobial screening: from hundreds of samples (natural product extracts and fractions) in manually performed assays in 96-well plates, to thousands of test compounds (synthetic compound libraries) in 384-well format using automated liquid handling." nohref="" />

Nurmi, Katariina
bioymp: University of Helsinki, Faculty of Biological and Environmental Sciences, Department of Biosciences, Division of Genetics
89
The innate immune system responds to infection or injury by initiating nonspecific inflammation, which functions to limit the spread of harmful microbes or the damage caused by tissue injury. The cells of the innate immune system are the first to encounter danger signals, and they mediate the rapid local immune response. Inflammatory reactions are normally beneficial for the host, and inflammation is usually resolved when the threat has been removed. However, in chronic inflammatory diseases, the danger signals either are not cleared or continue to be formed. Pathogen-derived molecules and danger signals induce the activation of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in the innate immune cells. Several families of PRRs exist, and their interplay is needed for the induction of efficient immune defense reactions.   Nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat-containing receptors (NLRs) are intracellular receptors that respond to a plethora of danger- and pathogen-associated molecular patterns. Their activation induces the assembly and activation of cytosolic multiprotein complexes called inflammasomes. Inflammasomes act as a primary checkpoint for the activation and secretion of the strong proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1² and IL-18. Similar to other cellular functions, innate immune responses are operated via a complicated interplay between signalosomes. To become activated inflammasomes require the coordinated activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and NLRs, which induce the activation and assembly of inflammasome complexes. The consequent secretion of inflammasome-derived cytokines is, in turn, modulated by autophagy. Inflammasome activation and autophagy also interact with cellular death pathways. Cellular death acts to limit the spread of intracellular pathogens by denying a protective niche to these pathogens, thereby inhibiting their replication and predisposing them for detection by the immune system.   The aim of this study was to investigate the roles of ethanol and hemin in the modulation of innate immune cell functions, as well as the mechanisms underlying the reported protective effects of ethanol and hemin against chronic inflammatory diseases. Alcohol is the most commonly and widely used drug in the world. The consequences of alcohol consumption depend on both the pattern of consumption and the amounts consumed. Alcohol abuse predisposes to more frequent and severe infections, whereas the light to moderate consumption of alcoholic beverages has been associated with a reduced incidence of chronic inflammatory conditions, such as cardiovascular diseases and rheumatoid arthritis. These seemingly different responses may both derive from attenuated reactions of innate immunity. In the present thesis study, ethanol was shown to reduce the viability and proliferation of mast cells. This reduced viability resulted from the immunologically silent apoptotic death of mast cells. In macrophages, ethanol reduced the pyroptotic cell death induced by inflammasome activation and instead directed cell death toward apoptosis.   Excessive inflammasome activation is a prominent feature of several chronic inflammatory diseases. The mechanisms that restrain inflammasome activation were studied in greater detail in cultured macrophages. Ethanol dose-dependently inhibited inflammasome activation and the secretion of IL-1² in human macrophages. It was further shown that the inhibitory effect of ethanol was mediated by a reduction in lysosomal disruption and the release of active cathepsin B, which thus contributed to diminished inflammasome assembly.   The majority of mammalian cells are constantly renewed. Enormous numbers of senescent red blood cells are phagocytosed daily by macrophages. In certain pathologies, such as malarial infection, massive hemolysis occurs that exceeds the capacity of the scavenging and degradation systems of hemoglobin. As a consequence, free heme and hemin are released into the circulation. Free heme and hemin are cytotoxic and proinflammatory compounds. However, heme and hemin are also potent inducers of the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) enzyme, which possesses anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective effects. In the present thesis study, hemin and its synthetic derivative cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP) blocked inflammasome activation and assembly. Decreased secretion of IL-1² was also observed in vivo in a nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat-containing family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3)-dependent peritonitis model in mice. The inhibitory effects of hemin and CoPP were partially dependent on the induction of HO-1 transcription by NF-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) and the enzymatic activity of HO-1. The inhibitory effects of hemin and CoPP were mediated by increased degradation of inflammasome components, which was due to elevated autophagy.   Overall, the results of this study demonstrate that ethanol and hemin markedly prevent inflammatory cellular responses in macrophages and mast cells. This inhibition may contribute to the cardioprotective effect of ethanol and the anti-inflammatory effects of hemin. An enhanced molecular understanding of the mechanisms by which ethanol and hemin inhibit inflammation may help reveal new therapeutic options in the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases." nohref="" />

Abstract   Roman sleep - Sleeping areas and sleeping arrangements in the Roman house   The main themes of this study are the sleeping areas and the sleeping arrangements in the ancient Roman house (domus). Sleeping is fundamentally important to the well-being of humans. In order to solve the sleep related problems, it is crucial to understand how sleeping is arranged in different societies past and present.   According to the premises for sociological sleep studies, especially outlined by Simon Williams,  how we sleep, when we sleep, where we sleep, what meanings we attribute to sleep, who we sleep with, are all important socially, culturally and historically variable matters . In this work, I have pursued a new, cross-disciplinary approach to the social aspects of ancient Roman sleeping culture by applying these premises and asking the research questions, how, when, where and with whom Romans slept, and which factors determined these arrangements, drawing on the evidence from Latin literature and Roman archaeology.   Written sources consist of Latin texts which mention sleeping and resting. Texts were chosen by using reference books and electronic databases and studied with source critical text analysis. Archaeological material was collected from private dwellings of Herculaneum, where evidence of beds has survived. The data concerning the material culture and architectonic elements of Herculaneum was gathered mainly from the excavation reports. In addition, I documented the houses during two short fieldwork periods. The data was studied by using the methods of buildings archaeology and artifact studies. The analysis of data was influenced by the theories on the use of domestic space and on the theories of privacy.   The main factors influencing the sleeping arrangements in Roman society included the social status, climate, urban culture, need for control, moralistic outlook as well as ritualistic behaviour. Roman households had routine-based nightly activities and very likely also permanent sleeping spaces. However, the locations of sleeping areas could have changed according to season. The wealthiest Romans appreciated the peaceful bedchambers and cubiculum was this separate, even private bedroom of the (elite) domus. Roman sleeping culture was biphasic, consisting of two main divisions: the midday rest and one period of sleep at night   The settings for sleeping among upper class Romans were more solitary than social and group sleeping among the members of the elite nuclear family in the houses was not typical. Slaves on duty slept outside the owner s bedroom rather than inside and, in general, slaves had few possibilities to influence their sleeping arrangements. Children were taken into consideration in all areas of life including sleeping arrangements.   Night-time and darkness influenced the Roman space use as well; even the Roman night was dark and full of terrors and sleeping had many negative connotations. However, in spite of the negative outlook on sleeping and night, even the positive aspects of resting were admitted, sleep deprivation was understood to be harmful and problems of sleeping were actively remedied." nohref="" />

The aim of this thesis was to investigate early childhood professionals  (ECP) stress regulation, work-related well-being and pedagogical work in kindergartens, as well as to determine whether these factors were connected. The demands that ECPs encounter at work and the resources available to them as well as the extent to which they experience engagement or burnout were analysed in order to increase understanding of the challenges involved in work that is simultaneously demanding and rewarding. In this thesis pedagogical work was seen as an indicator of ECP s job performance and quality of the early childhood education service. Furthermore, the focus was on physiological aspects relating to stress regulation. The goal was to enhance knowledge of working life in the field of early childhood education by utilising an interdisciplinary, integrative approach and multiple methodologies.   The study was part of two larger projects undertaken by the Department of Teacher Education at the University of Helsinki and involved two separate data sets. The first set was collected in 2009 from 117 ECPs in 24 kindergartens in the Helsinki metropolitan area. Participants in the second study (2012) were 89 ECPs from 21 integrated special kindergarten groups in the city of Helsinki. Data were collected through salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase measurements, observational assessments of pedagogical work and surveys measuring work-related well-being.   The results indicated that the ECPs generally found their work resources to be adequate, and, on average, their stress regulation was balanced. On average, the ECPs experienced high levels of work engagement, yet there were also participants who were less positive and showed moderate signs of burnout. In addition, the results demonstrated the importance of social support, especially the role of the supervisor, which proved to be one of the key factors positively enhancing well-being at work. The main findings demonstrated the close relationship between ECPs  stress regulation and the quality of pedagogical work in teams. However, no associations between different biomarkers and work engagement and burnout were found.   This study is novel in that it combines approaches from different disciplines to investigate work-related well-being among ECPs. The study highlights the importance of teamwork not only as fundamental to high-quality early childhood education, but also in supporting the well-being of ECPs. The findings can be applied in future studies and used to inform interventions intended to enhance working conditions in kindergartens." nohref="" />

Niemi, Pia-Maria
kasvatustieteellinen: University of Helsinki, Faculty of Behavioural Sciences, Department of Teacher Education
86
This study investigates the ways that schoolwide events can contribute to the creation of membership in a school community. An essential aspect of school life across grade levels and national contexts, the sense of membership refers to a situation in which a student is accepted as part of a group by others and feels connected with the other members of the community. The importance of membership has been highlighted in international studies that have shown the positive relation between students  sense of school belonging and several academic and non-academic features of their lives, such as their motivation for learning and general future orientation. To increase the knowledge of how school practices can support students  sense of membership, this study focuses on schoolwide events, including celebrations, theme days, and other organized activities for the entire school community's participation.   This study's main research question is as follows:  How do schoolwide events contribute to students  experiences of membership in the school community through a) personal-level experiences, b) school community-level practices, and c) representations of culture?  To answer this question, the study approaches the notion of membership from various disciplinary perspectives that originate from psychology, sociology, and educational sciences. The key concepts of this study are social integration, sense of belonging, and social representations of cultural communities that are investigated in the educational context of schoolwide events. This study consists of qualitative interview data from both students (Study I, data gathered in winter 2013 2014) and teachers (Study III, data gathered in autumn 2011), as well as quantitative survey data from students (Study II, data gathered in autumn 2013). Data were collected from four secondary schools of basic education (serving 13 16-year-old students) in the southern area of Finland. The student data were collected from three schools (referred to as Schools 1, 2, and 3), while the teacher data were collected from a fourth school.   This study's main findings answer the research question by showing that schoolwide events can contribute to students  experiences of membership by providing them with positive interpersonal encounters with their peers and in the school as a social community. The results also indicate that experiences of membership are disrupted by negative peer relations as well as by unfair and hasty practices when organizing events. Regarding cultural representations, the findings show that the events do not support students interpersonal understanding of various cultural traditions in any particular way, but instead the events focus on creating memberships in the broader context of the national (Finnish) community by transmitting its traditions. On the other hand, the results demonstrate that the notion of tradition is fluid and subjective to interpretation. The findings also indicate that students social and emotional experiences and personal involvement in schoolwide events are more remarkable aspects for creating membership than the factual content of the events. The findings also reveal that teachers and students approach the question of community building from different perspectives. Teachers emphasize the role of national traditions, while students call for inclusive events. However, both groups regard schoolwide events as avenues from which experiences of community and membership may emerge.   Concerning the study's practical implications, the results emphasize the important role of schoolwide events in the social life of the school and the need for researchers and practitioners to pay closer attention to such events. Based on the findings, this study also proposes practical implications for the development of the content and practices of schoolwide events in Finland and in other countries." nohref="" />

kasvatustieteellinen: University of Helsinki, Faculty of Behavioural Sciences, Department of Teacher Education
85
In this study, students'  discourse of science learning is explored with a special focus on interest in learning. The research group is an optional science class. The data consist of 20 interviews. The entire collection of interviews served as data for searching discourses, which further led to closer case studies. A portrait of the class is created, first searching dominant discourses and then taking a closer look at students who exemplify influential discourses contributing to interest generation in the whole class.  The research starts from individual narratives and follows the idea of Roth and Lucas (1997) that individuals belonging to a community represent the discourses of that community. Qualitative content analysis is used inductively to trace categories, which represent the interpretive repertoires of the students. By further abstraction, the latent contents of these discourses are abstracted to more general concepts in order to find recurrent patterns. Eventually, based on the created concepts and then deductively drawing on the theoretical models of Vygotsky, interest development, self-regulation and affective neuroscience, a model of the students  interest generation is formed.  The science class context offers the students possibilities to make choices. Students experience a feeling of succeeding when they understand the subject contents. This, in turn, creates a zeal for school and learning. Interest in learning seems to derive from a desire to succeed in life; a constant search for that which is new, exciting and fun; picking one's own  handbag  of choices; taking one's own action and feeling success; interest in the subject; and togetherness and identification with the science class. From the students'  experiences, a twofold image appears: students like projects, practical work and other student-centred methods, but they are not considered superior to the traditional teacher explanation, which in itself promotes understanding, leading to a feeling of succeeding. A clear division between students appears: those who expect firm teacher guidance and those who prefer independent working.  Belonging to a special class reinforces self-regulation. I construct a pattern, a pyramid of learning, where emotions, play and fun along with togetherness form the foundation for motivation. Learning and gaining experience contribute to increasing independence and the mastery of situations. One's own effort, attention and concentration make it possible to advance in learning and independence. The degree of teacher involvement needed depends on the individual student's position on this pyramid: on the bottom, more control and teacher guidance are needed, whereas students situated on the top of the pyramid are able to work on their own. Through a process of development aided by cultural and social influence, the students move in steps from bottom to top on the pyramid. These students are searching for their identities, picking up what is useful for them and building a set of knowledge and skills within the limits the school. I identify the science class as a community of the practice of science, where the how-aspect of science is conveyed from the science community through its practices and artefacts and is embraced and developed further by students through their social relations and communication.

Doctoral dissertation Inclusionary practices in a Finnish pre-primary school context has been made in the context of the five-year EU project Includ-Ed (2006- 2011), which has 14 European universities as partners. The aim of the research was to find out the most supportive practices and the most unsupportive practices from a perspective of inclusion experienced by agents (persons). Agents are children, parents, teachers and administration and organisation members who were interviewed by communicative open interview. There were a total of 54 interviews. Inclusion is examined through perspectives of transformation and critical communication. Critical communicative methodology assumes that people can interpret their own behaviour and modify their actions based on that.   To be able to analyse interviews, theory-based categories were used. After this, clusters were created using open categorisation. Of the results, when answering types are separated, 212 quotations were from professionals (teachers, administrators, members of organisations) whilst 88 quotations were from family and children. Professionals did make their voices heard more often than parents and children. Professionals gave over four times more transformative quotations than parents/children. Parents/children gave slightly more exclusionary quotations than professionals.   In the light of research findings, parents and children are still unable to make their voices heard as well as they could, and parents  attitude and preconceptions are unsupportive of inclusion. Lack of resources was the most unsupportive practice to inclusion according to the professionals. For all the agents, the most supportive practice to inclusion was co-operation.

Understanding the electronic structure of a chemical system in detail is essential for describing its chemical reactivity. In the present work, quantum chemical methods are applied in combination with experimental studies to achieve such detailed mechanistic understanding of chemical systems. Understanding the basic theory behind computational methods is of importance when applying them to chemical problems. Therefore, the first part of this work provides an introduction to quantum chemical methods.   The results of this work are published in four peer-reviewed publications. In each publication, the understanding of the chemical system has been obtained using a combination of experimental and quantum chemical studies. These include the design of a new-type of Au(III)-catalysts, and understanding mechanistic aspects related to a Au(III) catalytic cycle. We have also focused on understanding how the electronic structure of an alkyne affects the regioselectivity in the Pauson-Khand reaction. A computational model, which provides a qualitative and, to some extent, a quantitative prediction of regiochemical outcomes is presented." nohref="" />

Muszynski, Johann Michael
matlu:  Matemaattis-luonnontieteellinen tiedekunta, Fysiikan laitos

The presence of dislocations in metal crystals accounts for the plasticity of metals. These dislocations do not nucleate spontaneously, but require favorable conditions. These conditions include, but are not limited to, a high temperature, external stress, and an interface such as a grain boundary or a surface. The slip of dislocations leads to steps forming on the surface, as atomic planes are displaced along a line. If a void is placed very near a surface, the possibility of forming a dislocation platelet exists. The skip of the dislocation platelet would displace the surface atoms within a closed line. Repeating such a process may form a small protrusion on the surface.  In this thesis, the mechanism with which a dislocations displace the surface atoms within a closed loop is studied by using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of copper. A spherical void is placed within the lattice, and the lattice is then subjected to an external stress.   The dislocation reactions which lead to the formation of the dislocation platelet after the initial dislocation nucleation on the void is studied by running MD simulations of a void with the radius of 3 nm under tensile stress. Since the dislocations are thermally activated, the simulation proceeded differently for each run. We describe the different ways the dislocations nucleate, and the dislocation reactions that occur when they intersect to form the platelet.  The activation energy of this process was studied by simulating half of a much larger void, with a radius of 8 nm, in order to obtain a more realistic nucleation environment. Formulas connecting the observable and controllable simulation variables with the energies of the nucleation are derived. The activation energies are then calculated and compared with values from literature." nohref="" />

Marine environment is prolific in organisms with unique properties. Seas and oceans contain a wide diversity of species with biologically active metabolites that represent a valuable source with great potential for the development of novel therapeutic agents. This dissertation is focused on the biological study of synthetic compounds based on marine scaffolds as well as on marine natural product extracts originating from the Aegean Sea. Furthermore, it offers an introduction on the importance of marine natural products in the search of new bioactive compounds, the use of natural products as scaffolds for the synthesis of new drugs, and a general overview on bioactivity screening and the current status of marine-derived bioactive compounds as therapeutic agents.   The potential of oroidin and clathrodin as parent structures for synthesis of novel compounds was explored. Antimicrobial and antiproliferative studies were conducted and it was concluded that 4-phenyl-2-aminoimidazoles 6g(I) and 6h(I) showed the best antimicrobial effect against Gram-positive bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus), while compound 6j(I) showed the most interesting IC50 in antiproliferative studies. Compound 7(II), a synthetic derivative of 2-aminobenzothiazole, showed IC50 of 16 ¼M and 71 ¼M against a cancer cell line and a normal cell line, respectively. The selectivity index showed selectivity towards cancerous cells. In addition, okadaic acid was used as inspiration for the synthesis of crown ether acyl compounds. Compound (1,4,7,10,13,16-hexaoxacyclooctadecan-2-yl)methyl 3-(pyren-1-yl)propanoate) 1o(III) was found to be the most active in antimicrobial studies against Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus with a MIC50 of 7.2 ¼M.   The importance of bioprospecting the rich marine biodiversity in the Aegean Sea was also studied in this thesis. Biological activities of extracts from cyanobacteria, micro- and macroalgae were evaluated, and microalgae extracts (Amphora cf capitellata and Nitzschia communis) showed the most interesting antimicrobial results against Staphylococcus aureus and fungus Candida albicans.   The results of the biological studies conducted in this thesis demonstrated antimicrobial and antiproliferative activity of several marine natural products and their synthetic derivatives. Further studies and structural optimization should be done to fully explore their potential for the development of therapeutic agents." nohref="" />

The purpose of this thesis was to investigate the effectiveness of early mathematics interventions for young children with low performance in mathematics. Previous research has indicated that early mathematics skills are a strong predictor of later mathematics performance. The goal of early mathematics support by means of interventions is to improve mathematics performance, and consequently, to diminish the possibility of mathematics learning disability emerging later on. This thesis sought to complement and extend previous research in the field of early mathematics interventions, by reviewing early mathematics interventions, and investigating the effectiveness of two early mathematics intervention programmes.  Study I reviewed mathematics interventions (N = 19) aimed at 4 7-year-old children with low performance in mathematics. For each intervention, effect sizes were calculated for mathematics outcome measures, and the pedagogical implementation was described. The effectiveness of the RightStart Mathematics (RS) (Cotter, 2001) instruction was investigated in Studies II and III. In Study II, the instruction was provided for Finnish kindergartners (RS group: n = 38, comparison group: n = 32) in general education classrooms, with focus on low-performing children. In Study III, the RS instruction was provided in special education classrooms for children with a specific language impairment (SLI group: n = 9, comparison group: n = 32). In Study IV, a mathematics intervention programme Improving Mathematics Skills in the Second Grade (IMS-2) (Mononen & Aunio, 2012) was developed, and its effectiveness for second graders performing low in mathematics was examined (IMS-2 group: n = 11, low-performing controls: n = 13 and typically performing controls: n = 64). In Studies II-IV, quantitative methods were used for analysing the interventions  effects.   According to the results of the review, in the majority of the interventions, the mathematics skills of the participating children improved more than the skills of the children in control groups, with effect sizes varying from small to large. Progress in mathematics learning was evident when instruction included one or more of the following instructional features: explicit instruction, peer-assisted instruction, applying a concrete-representational-abstract sequence, computer assisted instruction, or games. Study II showed that the RS instruction was as effective as the typical Finnish kindergarten mathematics instruction. The counting skills of the initially low-performing children improved to the level of their typically performing peers. Follow-up in the first grade revealed performance differences between the initially low- and typically performing children, highlighting the importance of continuously monitoring progress, and providing intensified support. In Study III, children with a SLI receiving RS instruction improved their counting skills to the level of their peers. In the first grade follow-up, the children with SLI performed similarly to their peers in addition and subtraction skills (accuracy) and multi-digit number comparison. In Study IV, the mathematics skills of the second graders participating in the IMS-2 intervention did not improve more than the skills of the children in control groups. However, the study provided valuable information about the functionality of the IMS-2 programme s intensity and content.  To conclude, in general, the results indicate that rather than waiting for children to fail, mathematics interventions can be used successfully to promote the early mathematics skills of children with low performance in mathematics, already before the onset of formal schooling and in the early grades. Therefore, identifying low performance in mathematics and providing sufficient support should be emphasised already in early childhood education, in accordance with the Finnish three-tiered educational support system.

Miihkinen, Santeri
matlu: University of Helsinki, Faculty of Science, Department of Mathematics and Statistics
79
The topic of this dissertation lies at the intersection of analytic function theory and operator theory. In the thesis, compactness and structural properties of a class of Volterra-type (integral) operators acting on analytic function spaces are investigated. The Volterra-type operator is obtained by integrating a product of two analytic functions, where one of these functions, the so-called symbol of the operator, is fixed and the other one is considered to be a variable. This integral operator was introduced by C. Pommerenke in 1977 in connection to exponential integrability of BMOA-functions. A systematic research of Volterra-type operators was initiated by Aleman and Siskakis in the mid-1990s when they characterized the boundedness and compactness of these operators on the Hardy spaces and weighted Bergman spaces.   In the first article of the thesis, we derive estimates for the essential and weak essential norms of a Volterra-type operator in terms of its symbol when the operator is acting on the Hardy spaces, BMOA and VMOA. The essential and weak essential norms of a linear operator are its distances from compact and weakly compact operators respectively. In particular, it follows from our estimates that the compactness and weak compactness of Volterra-type operator coincide when its domain is the non-reflexive Hardy space, BMOA, or VMOA.   In the second article, a notion of strict singularity of a linear operator is investigated in the case of the Volterra-type operator acting on the Hardy spaces. An operator between Banach spaces is strictly singular if its restriction to any closed infinite-dimensional subspace is not a linear isomorphism onto its range. We construct an isomorphic copy M of the sequence space of p-summable sequences and show that a non-compact Volterra-type operator restricted to M is a linear isomorphism onto its range. This implies that the strict singularity and compactness of this operator coincide in the Hardy space case.   In the third article, we provide estimates for the operator norms and essential norms of the Volterra-type operator acting between weighted Bergman spaces, where the weight function satisfies a doubling condition." nohref="" />

Meinander, Kristian

78
The highly prostate specific serine protease kallikrein-related peptidase 3 (KLK3, also known as prostate specific antigen, PSA) is widely used as a biomarker for prostate cancer and it has also been postulated that it may play a part in tumour growth. Especially interestesting is the antiangiogenic effect exerted by proteolytically active KLK3 in cell line models. In order to stimulate the proteolytic activity of KLK3, a series of peptides have been developed by phage display methodology. Even though the peptides are quite potent KLK3 stimulators, they are not directly suitable for in vivo studies or use as drugs.   Even though there are many natural and unnatural biologically active peptides, they suffer from rapid clearance via the liver and kidneys and proteolytic degradation of the compounds both in the gastrointestinal tract and other parts of the body. This gives peptides a poor oral bioavailability meaning that they are usually administered as intravenous or intramuscular injections. Several different strategies have been developed in order to access compounds with improved bioavailability including modifications of the peptide structure, development of pseudopeptides and development of small molecular weight peptidomimetics.   This thesis concentrates on the further development of the two most potent peptides known to stimulate KLK3, i.e. B-2 and C-4. The main part of the work was concentrated on the replacement of disulphide bridges in the peptides in order to both gain more information on which residues are necessary for obtaining the biological activity and at the same time also gain information on how changes to the geometry of the disulphide bridge affects the activity.   A series of different disulphide bridge mimicking building blocks were designed and synthesised with the intention of using them in a protocol for solid-phase synthesis of KLK3 stimulating peptides. Unfortunately, the use of these building blocks in the synthesis of pseudopeptides based on C-4 turned out to be an unsurmountable challenge and the synthesis had to be completed using a different strategy in which the key step was the use of ring-closing metathesis (RCM) for the cyclisation of the partly completed pseudopeptide. Pleasingly, the synthesis of pseudopeptide analogues of the B-2 peptide using the building blocks was more successful. In total three pseudopeptide analogues of C-4 and four of B-2 were synthesised and shown to retain the biological activity of the parent peptides.   Based on the information from the synthesised pseudopeptides and a molecular modelling study, a 4-quinolone based peptidomimetic was designed to mimic the C-4 peptide and a synthetic protocol was devised to access this compound. Even though the synthesis of the desired target compound has so far not been successful, the synthetic protocol that was designed has given access to a number of 1,2,8-trisubstituted 4-quinolone derivatives." nohref="" />

Matikainen, Minna

77
The pharmaceutical industry has a vital reliance on successful new product launches (NPL), which are a critical driver of a company s performance. The prevailing literature on NPLs is fragmented and has mainly concentrated on a product s superiority as well as the strategic and tactical launch activities largely omitting the importance of customer relationships. The aim of this thesis is to provide a comprehensive overview on the key determinants of a successful NPL in the Finnish pharmaceutical industry. In practice, this study considers the extent to which a NPL and getting physicians  to prescribe a new drug is relational activity.   The role and relative impact of a company s strategic orientations and their mediating mechanisms were studied with survey data collected from the pharmaceutical companies operating in Finland. Partial least squares (PLS) path modeling revealed that the relationship orientation had the strongest positive impact on both customer acceptance and financial launch success. The company s accumulated market-based assets represented an alternative mediator in addition to product advantage. Sales force management and relationship marketing activities transformed a relationship-oriented organizational culture into launch performance. PLS regression modeling combined with target projection identified the diversity of determinants affecting launch performance at different stages of NPL. Product advantage and relationship marketing activities contributed to gaining the acceptance of key opinion leaders in the early phase of launch, while market-based assets and a company s relationship orientation largely determined the acceptance of the majority of target customers in the later phase.   The buyer s perspective focused on the physician-pharmaceutical industry relationship and was studied by means of theme-interviews among a randomized sample of physicians. The positive relationship orientation of the physicians towards the pharmaceutical industry and whether they actively interacted with pharmaceutical companies were reflected in their early adoption of new drugs, especially when a product had a unique advantage and the physician s own personal interest accelerated the adoption of a new drug. In comparison, physicians who were negatively oriented towards the pharmaceutical industry and interacted passively adopted a new drug later based on evidence- and experience-based reasoning and the opinions of colleagues.   In conclusion, this thesis calls for a relationship approach in order to complement the traditional sales and marketing approach regarding the launch of new pharmaceutical products. A successful pharmaceutical product launch should focus on appropriate relationship marketing activities that are conducted in a timely manner to achieve customer acceptance and financial launch performance." nohref="" />

Marttila, Ville
humanistinen: University of Helsinki, Faculty of Arts, Department of Modern Languages, English Philology
76
This thesis presents a corpus-linguistically oriented digital documentary edition of six 15th-century culinary recipe collections, known as the Potage Dyvers family, with an introduction to its historical context and an analysis of its dialectal and structural features, and defines an editorial framework for producing such editions for the purposes of corpus linguistic research. Traditionally historical corpora have been compiled from printed editions not originally designed to serve as corpus linguistic data. Recently, both the digitalisation of textual editing and the turning of corpus compilers towards original sources have blurred the boundaries between these two crafts, placing corpus compilers into an editorial role. Despite the fact that traditional editorial approaches have been recognised as largely incompatible with the needs of linguistic research, and the established methods of corpus encoding do not satisfactorily represent the documentary context of manuscript texts, no explicitly linguistic editorial approach has so far been designed for editing manuscript sources for use in corpora. Even most digital editions, despite their advanced representational capabilities, are literary or historical in orientation and thus do not provide an adequate model.   The editorial framework described here and the edition based on it have been explicitly designed to answer the needs of historical corpus linguistics. First, it aims at faithfully modelling the manuscript as a historical artefact, including both its textual content and its visual and material paratext, whose communicative importance has also been recognised by many historical linguists. Second, it presents this model in a form which allows not only the study of both text and paratext using corpus linguistic methods, but also allows resulting analytical metadata to be linked back to the edition, shared with other scholars, and used as the basis for further study. The edition itself is provided as a digital appendix to the thesis in the form of both a digital data archive encoded in TEI XML and three editorial presentations of this data, and serves not only as a demonstration of the editorial approach, but also provides a valuable new research resource.   The choice of material is based on the insight that utilitarian texts like recipes provide valuable material especially for historical pragmatics and discourse studies. As one of the first vernacular text types, recipes also provide an excellent opportunity to study the diachronic development of a single textual genre. The Potage Dyvers family is the second largest known family of Middle English recipe collections, surviving in six physically diverse manuscripts. Of these, four were edited in 1888 by conflating them into two collections, but their complex interrelationships have so far escaped systematic study. The structural analysis of the six Potage Dyvers versions indicates that the family, containing a total of 371 unique recipes, in fact consists of three sibling pairs of MSS. Two of these contain largely the same material but in a different order, while the third shares only a core of 89 recipes with the others, deriving a large number of recipes from other sources. In terms of their language, all of the six versions exhibit mainly Midlands forms and combine dialectally unmarked forms with more local variants from different areas, reflecting the 15th-century loss of dialectal distinctions which has not yet reached orthographic or morphological uniformity, and indicating possible metropolitan associations." nohref="" />

Mäkelä, Minja
matlu: University of Helsinki, Faculty of Science, Department of Physics
75
The focus of this thesis is on observations of star-forming globules that have cometary morphologies and are associated with or located in HII regions. Our study presents a sample of globules at different size-scales and investigates their structure, formation mechanism, and star formation using observations made at infrared (IR) and millimeter (mm)-wave wavelengths. The studied globules offer examples of associated low-mass star formation triggered by the influence of an HII region.   Infrared, mm, and radio observations are fundamental in detecting signs of on-going star formation embedded inside dusty, dense globules. The embedded young stellar objects (YSOs) are detected directly in the IR and indirectly via jets and outflows in shocked H2 and mm-wave CO observations.   This thesis is a case study of different types of globules. Cometary globules (CGs) represent the classical globules with sizes of ~0.1-1 pc and masses of ~10 M_sun, and the so-called globulettes are an order of magnitude smaller than CGs. We observe on-going low-mass star formation in both types of globules. Compression associated with radiation from the hot central star (via so-called radiation driven implosion, RDI) is suggested as the cause. The star formation in the globulettes may result in low-mass stars and/or possibly in free-floating planetary-mass objects.   Five publications are included, two of which discuss two cometary globules, CG 1 and CG 2, in the Gum Nebula. Earlier studies have discovered a pre-main sequence star outside the head of CG 1, and we find second generation star formation in the head of CG 1 which contains an embedded object and a large outflow cavity. Two near-IR (NIR)-excess objects are seen in the direction of CG 1 tail and one in the head of CG 2. Our original goal was to study if the CG formation mechanism is triggered by supernovae shocks or by RDI, but based on the observations, we cannot fully determine between the two.   The next two papers discuss mm-wave and NIR observations of small globulettes in the Rosette Nebula. Globulettes have not been studied in the NIR before this. The globulettes are dense and they are irradiated by ultraviolet radiation from the central Rosette cluster which causes bright fluorescent H2 rims in the globulettes in the NIR. The globulettes are observed along with long pillars of gas extending toward the central cluster, so-called elephant trunks. These together form a system that expands at the same velocity from the central cluster. Star formation is on-going in the largest Rosette globulette observed in this study and in the tip of one elephant trunk.   The final paper reports NIR observations of two globules on the inner molecular shell of the Rosette Nebula. They have fluorescent H2 rims similar to the globulettes. A NIR-excess object is located in the direction of one globule and the other contains an embedded YSO. The YSO drives an outflow seen in shocked H2. Imaging in the optical and NIR suggest that the outflow is parsec-scaled and interacts with the shell of the Rosette Nebula.   The globules we observed are subject to ionizing radiation from OB stars, which photo-erodes the globules and drives the RDI process. Star formation takes place in all globule types we observed, and the second generation star in the head of CG 1 is indicative of triggered star formation. The first detailed NIR and mm-wave observations of the Rosette Nebula globulettes are presented here. Star formation is detected in one globulette and in one of the associated elephant trunks, but we cannot determine if the globulettes can collapse to directly form brown dwarfs or planetary-mass objects. Future observations using ALMA and other high-resolution instruments are needed in determining the physical and chemical structure of the globulettes." nohref="" />

74
The time of arrival of interneurons and oligodendrocytes to the neocortex is critical for proper functional brain development. Aberrances in this sequence can be detrimental, and involved in different developmental diseases. Thus, understanding the mechanisms for temporal control of the genesis and migration of neural cells is crucial. The aim of this study was to focus on the ventral telencephalon, a major source of interneurons and oligodendrocytes, in more detail.   A more sensitive method was developed for detecting and quantifying oligodendrocyte precursor cells, e.g. Olig2. The device decloaking chamber was compared to the microwave oven-based heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) method by studying the labeling of Olig2 marker in paraffin-embedded sections from embryonic mouse brain. The results demonstrated that the decloaking chamber-based HIER method is the most suitable technique for the detection of single Olig2-labeled cells in the ventral telencephalon. This qualitative result was reflected in the quantitative analyses: more Olig2-labeled cells were quantifiable with the decloaking chamber- than with the microwave oven-approach. Thus, the decloaking chamber-based HIER method constitutes a sensitive technique for the detection of oligodendrocyte precursor cells, and therefore for its quantification in the developing ventral telencephalon.   The development of telencephalon depends on fundamental processes, which include proliferation and migration of neural cells. The Na-K-Cl cotransporter isoform 1 (NKCC1) is an important protein for the process of volume regulation, and has been implicated in cell division. Within the developing brain, the ventral telencephalon showed the highest expression of NKCC1. This expression corresponded to neural progenitor cells in the lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE). Using NKCC1 knockout mice, it was demonstrated that NKCC1 influenced cell cycle reentry. Consequently, mice lacking NKCC1 have impaired Sp8-expressing interneurons and Olig2-labeled cells. Thus, NKCC1 is crucial in vivo for cell cycle decision, thereby altering the production of oligodendrocyte and interneuron progenitor cells in the LGE.   Once interneurons are born, they migrate to the neocortex. The implication of syndecan-3 was assessed in their tangential migration. The results showed that the Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor GDNF interacts with syndecan-3 to promote the tangential migration of calbindin-expressing interneurons within the telencephalon. Consistently, mice lacking syndecan-3 have an accumulation of migrating interneurons in the LGE.   In summary, two important mechanisms were found for temporal and spatial control of cortical oligodendrocytes and interneurons." nohref="" />

Lumme, Erkka
matlu:  Matemaattis-luonnontieteellinen tiedekunta, Fysiikan laitos
73
Magnetic field has a central role in many dynamical phenomena in the solar corona, and the accurate determination of the coronal magnetic field holds the key to solving a whole range of open research problems in solar physics. In particular, realistic estimates for the magnetic structure of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) enable better understanding of the initiation mechanisms of these eruptions as well as more accurate forecasts of their space weather effects.  Due to the lack of direct measurements of the coronal magnetic field the best way to study the field evolution is to use data-driven modelling, in which routinely available photospheric remote sensing measurements are used as a boundary condition. Magnetofrictional method (MFM) stands out from the variety of existing modelling approaches as a particularly promising method. The approach is computationally inexpensive but still has sufficient physical accuracy. The data-based input to the MFM is the photospheric electric field as the photospheric boundary condition.   The determination of the photospheric electric field is a challenging inversion problem, in which the electric field is deduced from the available photospheric magnetic field and plasma velocity measurements. This thesis presents and discusses the state-of-the-art electric field inversion methods and the properties of the currently available photospheric measurements. The central outcome of the thesis project is the development and testing of a novel ELECTRICIT software toolkit that processes the photospheric magnetic field data and uses it to invert the photospheric electric field. The main motivation for the toolkit is the coronal modelling using MFM, but the processed magnetic field and electric field data products of the toolkit are usable also in other applications such as force-free extrapolations or high-resolution studies of photospheric evolution.   This thesis presents the current state of the ELECTRICIT toolkit as well as the optimization and first tests of its functionality. The tests show that the toolkit can already in its current state produce photospheric electric field estimates to a reasonable accuracy, despite the fact that some of the state-of-the-art electric field inversion methods are yet to be implemented in the toolkit. Moreover, the optimal values of the free parameters in the currently implemented inversion methods are shown to be physically justifiable.   The electric field inversions of the toolkit are also used to study other questions. It is shown that the large noise levels of the vector magnetograms in the quiet Sun cause the inverted electric field to be noise-dominated, and thus the magnetic field data from this region should not be considered in the inversion. Another aspect that is studied is the electric field inversion based only on line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms, which is a considerable option due to much shorter cadence and better availability of the LOS data. The tests show that the inversions based on the LOS data have large errors when compared to the vector data based inversions. However, the results are shown to have reasonable consistency in the horizontal components of the electric field, when the region of interest is near the centre of the solar disk." nohref="" />

Luisto, Rami
matlu: University of Helsinki, Faculty of Science, Department of Mathematics and Statistics
72
In this dissertation we study the theory of quasiregular- and BLD-mappings. The unifying theme of the dissertation is how results and techniques used in the study of one of these classes gives rise to ideas in the theory of the other.   The first paper in the thesis concerns the theory of quasiregular mappings, which are non-homeomorphic generalizations of quasiconformal mappings; heuristically quasiregular mappings can be defined as mappings that map infinitesimal balls to infinitesimal ellipsoids with a bound on the eccentricity of the ellipsoid. The first article is especially focused on quasiregularly elliptic manifolds, i.e. those closed Riemannian manifolds for which there exists a non-constant quasiregular mapping from the euclidean space of same dimension to the manifold. The classes of quasiregularly elliptic 2- and 3-manifolds are classified up to a quasiconformal homeomorphism. In higher dimensions it is still a widely open question which closed manifolds are quasiregularly elliptic, but even though a complete classification of quasiregularly elliptic manifolds is hard, there are results restricting the structure of quasiregulary elliptic manifolds. One of the basic results is the Varopoulos theorem that gives an upper bound to the growth rate of the fundamental group of a quasiregularly elliptic manifold. The main result of the first paper is that if the growth rate of the fundamental group of a quasiregularly elliptic manifold is as large as possible, then the manifold is in fact a finite quotient of a torus.   Mappings of bounded length distorion, BLD-mappings for short, were first defined by Martio and Väisälä in 1988 in euclidean domains as a subclass of quasiregular mappings. Even though the original defintion of BLD-mappings was analytical, Martio and Väisälä showed that there exists also a definition with a more metric flavor. Indeed, BLD-mappings can be defined as those open, continuous and discrete mappings that preserve the length of all paths up to a uniform multiplicative constant. This definition lends itself to all (path-)metric spaces, and in the latter two articles of the thesis we study which classical results of euclidean BLD- or quasiregular mappings can be proven in the setting of locally compact and complete path-metric spaces." nohref="" />

Virus-host systems in sea ice   Sea ice is one of the largest habitats on Earth. A specialized microbial community lives inside the narrow brine channels that are formed during freezing process, when salt and other components from sea water concentrate between ice crystals. These microbes have an active role in the biogeochemistry of the sea ice by primary production, degradation of material and excreation of compounds, which effect the gas exchange between the ocean and atmosphere and the nutrient status of the under ice sea. Sea ice microbial community consist of auto- and heterotrophic protists, prokaryotes and viruses. The main heterotrophs are the bacteria.   Viruses are the most abundant lifeform on Earth. They are found everywhere where there is life and they infect all kinds of cells. Infections are crucial for viruses because they can reproduce only by using a host cell to produce new virus particles. Majority of the viruses infect the most numerous cells on Earth, the prokaryotes, i.e. bacteria and archaea. Viruses infecting bacteria (bacteriophages or phages) are a major factor in bacterial mortality. They can also control the community composition of bacteria because of the high specificity of the infection. Bacteria have different mechanisms to avoid phage infections and phages need to evolve to be able to reproduce. This arms race of phages and bacteria can lead to co-evolution. Although viruses are known to have significant effects on bacterial communities in various habitats, not much is known about the viruses in the sea ice. Before this project, only three isolates have been reported from the Arctic sea ice.   The aim in this thesis was to get a better understanding of the phages and their role in sea ice. For that, isolation, cultivation and purification methods needed to be developed and optimized. Bacteria and phages were isolated from samples taken from Baltic and Antarctic sea ice. The phage particles were purified and characterized by their morphology, structural protein patterns and host range. The identities of the host bacteria were analyzed by their 16S rRNA gene sequence. Effect of temperature on the host bacterial growth and phage infections, and the adsorption and life cycle of the phages, was experimentally studied. The abundance of virus-like particles in Antarctic sea ice was analyzed using flow cytometry.   The first phage-host systems were isolated from Baltic Sea ice and Antarctic sea ice. All of the phages infected bacterial strains belonging to genera that are typically abundant in sea ice i.e. Shewanella, Flavobacterium, Paraglaciecola and Octadecabacter. All the bacterial strains and phages were cold-active. The adsorption and life cycle of phages was suprisingly fast at tested 4 °C. The phage infections were specific to certain bacterial strains. A complex phage-host system network was seen among two of the phages and 15 closely related bacterial strains from Antarctica, which may be a result of co-evolution. The abundance of virus-like particles in melted Antarctic winter sea ice (105 106 particles ml-1 bulk ice) was high when considering that they are normally concentrated in the brine channels.   The amount of virus-like particles in sea ice even during Antarctic winter, indicates that viruses are an active and important member of the sea ice microbial community. Adsorption and life cycle studies show that phage infections may be efficient in the closed and concentrated environment of sea ice brines. By the strain specificic infections the phages can control the bacterial community composition and this way effect the community functions. The co-evolution of phages and bacteria may be important factor in the bacterial evolution." nohref="" />

Lindborg, Marjaana

All stars that have outer convection zones show magnetic activity. This activity strengthens with angular velocity and depth of the convection zone. Cool starspots are believed to be caused by local magnetic field concentrations on the surfaces of stars. They show up as dark regions against a bright photosphere and are observable manifestations of the internal dynamo activity. Therefore the solar dynamo is not unique, only one example of a cyclic dynamo. This makes studies of magnetic activity in other stars important.   The convection zone is believed to be the source area of the solar dynamo. The distributed dynamo paradigm is relying on magnetic field generation throughout the convection zone, while the flux-transport paradigm is based on the Babcock-Leighton -effect near the surface in which the mean poloidal field is produced by the merging of twisted magnetic loops. Mean-field dynamo models can produce many observed features both of the solar cycle and some of the features seen in active rapid rotators, but it remains yet under debate which dynamo paradigm is correct. Especially in the case of the Sun, the kinematic mean-field models of different types can lead to a satisfactory reproduction of the solar cycle main properties. These two prevailing dynamo paradigms are briefly introduced in this thesis, as well as their current challenges.   For II Peg our time series covers both states of high and low activity. Furthermore we discover a drift of the active region. This drift is also confirmed from photometry, with the carrier fit analysis. The most natural explanation for it would be an azimuthal dynamo wave. DI Psc is a rapidly rotating single giant, which has an interestingly high lithium concentration. We examine the spot behaviour for a two years time-span, and retrieve changes in the activity, which could indicate a fast activity cycle of only a few years." nohref="" />

Ions in the keV energy range are regularly used in the semiconductor industry for device fabrication. Irradiation with ions of higher energies can also induce favorable structural changes in the irradiated samples. Among these, irradiation effects of the so-called swift heavy ions (SHIs, heavy ions with specific energies in the 1 MeV / amu range) in electrically insulating materials are particularly interesting.   Despite the wide range of existing applications (filters, printed circuit boards and geological dating) and application potential (fuel cells, cell mimicking membranes) of SHI irradiation, the mechanisms by which SHIs interact with insulators are still under debate. Modelling of SHIs is a very challenging task as, contrary to ions with lower energies, they mostly interact with electrons, inducing lots of electronic excitations. Incorporating the latter with atomistic dynamics is especially difficult in insulators, and the methods have not yet been fully established.   SHIs can induce a cylindrical region of structural transformation known as an ion track. In crystalline silicon dioxide, a track consists of an amorphized region that is typically several microns long and has a radius of less than ten nanometers. Furthermore, it was recently found out that SHI irradiation can be used to induce a shape transformation in metal nanoclusters (NCs) that are embedded in amorphous silicon dioxide. Spherical NCs (radius 1-50 nm) elongate along the ion beam direction and are shaped into nanorods or prolate spheroids. The phenomenon can be exploited to produce large arrays of equally aligned nanoclusters within a solid substrate, which is difficult to achieve otherwise.   In this thesis, ion track formation and the elongation of gold nanoclusters in silicon dioxide are studied using so called two-temperature molecular dynamics simulations. The structure of the tracks is studied and a mechanism is proposed for the nanoparticle elongation effect. The work presented here is a step towards the understanding of SHI related effects in a broader range of insulating materials for the SHI based applications." nohref="" />

Lehti, Satu

68
Aortic stenosis and athrosclerosis are slowly progressing diseases. Being clinically silent, as they start developing decades before they cause symptoms, cardiovascular diseases and atherosclerosis in particular, are the leading cause of morbitidy and mortality in the Western world. Lipid accumulation begins both in the artery walls and in the aortic valves before any clinical signs of atherosclerosis or aortic stenosis can be detected. While atherosclerotic lesions are characterized with cells filled with lipid droplets i.e. foam cells, and they are found to be calcified only in the late stages of atherosclerosis, the stenotic aortic valve leaflets contain both lipid droplets and calcified nodules already in early lesions. The proteoglycan matrix common to artery wall and aortic valve leaflets retains the entering lipoprotein particles that are then enzymatically and oxidatively modified. Such modifications have an ability to transform the non-inflammatory plasma lipoprotein particles into crystals and particles that can induce sterile inflammation in the various intimal and valvular cells. This thesis was set to study the distribution and characteristics of the extracellular lipid and to reveal the origin of the extracellular lipid particles. Prior to the analyses of the isolated extracellular lipid particles, the human carotid artery plaques were imaged with three-dimensional electron microscopy and sections of human coronary arteries were analyzed with imaging mass spectrometry to study the spatial distribution of lipids in different stages of atherosclerosis. In the human coronary arteries, the lipid domains found in advanced atherosclerotic lesions were different from the domains found in atheroma-stage artery sections, and even more different from healthy sections of coronary arteries. In the human carotid artery plaques, cholesterol crystals were found to be large sheets or needle-like structures, and they appeared to be growing out from large lipid particles in the intima. For the purpose of studying the chemical and physical characteristics of the extracellular lipid particles, the extracellular particles were isolated from aortic valve leaflets and coronary artery plaques. The lipid particles were examined with multiple tools to study their lipid composition, protein composition, protein structure, size, and density. The extracellular lipid particles, both in human aortic valve leaflets and human carotid arteries, were found to be derived from plasma lipoproteins, mainly from low density lipoprotein (LDL) or very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). Apart from multiple small exchangeable lipoproteins, like apolipoprotein (apo) E, apoA-family, and apoC-family, the particles contained mainly apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100), the integral protein of LDL and VLDL, and they contained features which suggest that they were multiply modified. Another goal was to find which modifications would change the intimal or valvular extracellular lipid particles to such fused and aggregated lipid particles that were found in the valves and intimal plaques, and which modifications would induce a sterile inflammatory response similar to the response the extracellular lipid particles induce. To study the possible culprit modifications, both the extracellular lipid particles, in vitro-generated cholesterol crystals, and LDL that was modified by lipolysis, proteolysis, and oxidation, were applied to human primary monocyte-derived macrophages. Both the isolated extracellular lipid particles and LDL modified with a combination of phospholipolysis by PLA2 and cholesterol esterase were found to be able to activate a multiprotein complex inflammasome in human primary monocyte-derived macrophages in vitro, and to induce the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. According to the results of this thesis, the lipid particles in the arterial intima and in the aortic valve are active components of atherosclerosis and aortic stenosis. They can induce the cells in the intima and in the valve to produce inflammatory cytokines and thus can affect the progress of these diseases." nohref="" />

Lehtiö, Lari
matlu: University of Helsinki, Faculty of Biosciences, Department of Biological and Environmental Sciences
67
The first glycyl radical in an enzyme was described 20 years ago and since then the family of glycyl radical enzymes (GREs) has expanded to include enzymes catalysing five chemically distinct reactions. The type enzymes of the family, anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase (RNRIII) and pyruvate formate lyase (PFL) had been studied long before it was known that they are GREs. Spectroscopic measurements on the radical and an observation that exposure to oxygen irreversibly inactivates the enzymes by cleavage of the protein proved that the radical is located on a particular glycine residue, close to the C-terminus of the protein. Both anaerobic RNRIII and PFL, are important for many anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria as RNRIII is responsible for the synthesis of DNA precursors and PFL catalyses a key metabolic reaction in glycolysis. The crystal structures of both were solved in 1999 and they revealed that, although the enzymes do not share significant sequence identity, they share a similar structure - the radical site and residues necessary for catalysis are buried inside a ten stranded $\
lpha $/$\¾ta $-barrel.   GREs are synthesised in an inactive form and are post-translationally activated by an activating enzyme which uses S-adenosyl methionine and an iron-sulphur cluster to generate the radical. One of the goals of this thesis work was to crystallise the activating enzyme of PFL. This task is challenging as, like GREs, the activating component is inactivated by oxygen. The experiments were therefore carried out in an oxygen free atmosphere. This is the first report of a crystalline GRE activating enzyme.   Recently several new GREs have been characterised, all sharing sequence similarity to PFL but not to RNRIII. Also, the genome sequencing projects have identified many PFL-like GREs of unknown function, usually annotated as PFLs. In the present thesis I describe the grouping of these PFL family enzymes based on the sequence similarity and analyse the conservation patterns when compared to the structure of E. coli PFL. Based on this information an activation route is proposed. I also report a crystal structure of one of the PFL-like enzymes with unknown function, PFL2 from Archaeoglobus fulgidus. As A. fulgidus is a hyperthermophilic organism, possible mechanisms stabilising the structure are discussed. The organisation of an active site of PFL2 suggests that the enzyme may be a dehydratase.

66
The outer convective envelopes of late-type stars are believed to support turbulent dynamos that are able to generate strong and dynamic magnetic fields. When these magnetic fields penetrate the stellar surface, they give rise to directly observable activity phenomena, such as dark spots and line emission from the chromospheric layers. Observing and analyzing these activity indicators allows us to characterize the behaviour of the dynamos on a wide range of different stars as well as to put the behaviour of the Sun into a wider context.   This thesis presents a study of the activity of a sample of 21 young solar-type stars that can be seen as analogues of the Sun during the first few hundred million years of its existence. The aim is to characterize their activity behaviour on different time scales from months to decades as well as to derive estimates for the magnitude of their surface differential rotation. The results of the analysis provide important observational constraints for the dynamo theory.   The study is primarily based on the time series analysis of up to three decades of photometric monitoring of the sample stars. The light curves of these stars display quasiperiodic variations that are induced by changing patterns of dark starspots on the stellar surface and the rotation of the star. The time series analysis results are supplemented by spectroscopic observations that are used to determine the chromospheric activity levels of the stars.   The time series analysis is performed using the Continuous Period Search and Carrier Fit methods along with a selection of additional complementary tools. The development of the Continuous Period Search method forms a part of this thesis. This method is fully characterized and its performance is tested on noisy low amplitude light curve data.   The photometric analysis reveals new results from both activity cycles and the longitudinal distribution of the spot activity on the stars. Furthermore, it confirms previously published results concerning these and the strength of the surface differential rotation using a new sample of stars. The results show that activity cycles of different lengths are common on active solar-type stars and that their lengths fall on a set of distinct branches.   When the longitudinal distribution of the spot activity is compared to the activity level of the stars, the results show a clear domain shift between stars that have axisymmetric spot distributions and stars where the spot activity shows stable longitudinal concentration. Such concentration of activity, known as active longitudes, only appears on the faster rotating more active stars. This suggests a transition between axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric dynamo modes as a function of the activity level of a star. The active longitudes also show a tendency to follow prograde propagation with respect to the stellar rotation. This may be interpreted either as a signature of radial differential rotation or as an azimuthal dynamo wave." nohref="" />

65
The interaction between Greek and Egyptian cultural concepts has been an intense yet controversial topic in studies about Ptolemaic Egypt. The present study partakes in this discussion with an analysis of the encomiastic poems of Callimachus of Cyrene (c. 305   c. 240 BC). The success of the Ptolemaic Dynasty is crystallized in the juxtaposing of the different roles of a Greek ²±Ã¹»µÍÂ and of an Egyptian Pharaoh, and this study gives a glimpse of this political and ideological endeavour through the poetry of Callimachus. The contribution of the present work is to situate Callimachus in the core of the Ptolemaic court. Callimachus was a proponent of the Ptolemaic rule. By reappraising the traditional Greek beliefs, he examined the bicultural rule of the Ptolemies in his encomiastic poems.   This work critically examines six Callimachean hymns, namely to Zeus, to Apollo, to Artemis, to Delos, to Athena and to Demeter together with the Victory of Berenice, the Lock of Berenice and the Ektheosis of Arsinoe. Characterized by ambiguous imagery, the hymns inspect the ruptures in Greek thought during the Hellenistic age. These poems link Ptolemaic kings and queens with the deities they address and embroider this linkage with Egyptian cultural concepts. The Victory of Berenice and the Lock of Berenice contain a subtext in which Berenice II is portrayed in Egyptian terms whereas the Ektheosis of Arsinoe examines the mortuary aspects of Graeco-Egyptian Ptolemaic Egypt.   The Ptolemies created a new audience for the poets of their court when they established a bilingual cadre of scribes. The scribes, together with the indigenous priests, were a heterogeneous group, but some were thoroughly Hellenized, as the case of Manetho confirms. The encomiastic poetry of Callimachus legitimized the status of the Ptolemies amid the native Egyptian elite, but also made their style of kingship more familiar to the Greeks." nohref="" />

The focus of the study is to identify how mediation supports a web-based course on self-regulation. In the context of education, mediation can be defined as a supporter or promoter of learning. Mediation selects, interprets, and amplifies objects for human learners. The study creates an integrated view of mediators as learning promoters based on Vygotsky s (1978) and Feuerstein s theories (1990, 1991) for studying mediators in web-based learning. This study presents an integrated definition of mediators which focuses on the task, quality and types of mediators and suggests the following: (1) mediators are learning promoters who trigger, support, and amplify learning; (2) learning requires high-quality mediators, and the quality of mediation is ensured by mediated learning experiences; and (3) mediators can be social/human mediators or tool/symbolic mediators. This integrated view is then evaluated based on the empirical research results.   The study analyzes an asynchronous web-based learning environment (IQ Form) from the perspective of mediation; this learning environment was designed for the Finnish Virtual University (FVU). The research setting involves students from the Karelia University of Applied Sciences. The IQ Form environment aims to help students take charge of their own learning process, i.e., develop their self-regulative strategies and skills. The IQ Learn section of IQ Form includes tests, a tutorial with assignments, and a diary to develop students  learning skills and strategies.   The research focuses on mediators that support learning self-regulation by analyzing students' experiences of learning support on a web-based course for learning self-regulation. The methodological approach used, on a philosophical level, qualitatively relies on phenomenology, while at the methodological level, the approach relies on the qualitative research tradition. The study includes two pre-studies and one actual research phase. The main source of data was 14 interviews of first-year students in a Business Information Technology degree program. In addition, 12 students were included in the two pre-studies. The interview data were also supported by the students  56 diary texts, which were comprised of written assignments sent to their online teacher and background information collected from the students. The data analysis developed into a triangulation between qualitative clustering, a structured empirical phenomenological analysis, and a narrative analysis. The phenomenological analysis was decisive for finding the mediators.   The research results suggest five kinds of mediators in this web-based self-regulation setting. The phenomenological analysis made it possible to discover the mediators supporting or triggering students  learning processes. The mediators found were the following: own pace, own space, own face, human and tool.   The mediators own pace, space and face were born situationally due to the special circumstances of web-based learning; they were not pre-designed or arranged as were the human and tool mediators. As a mediator, own pace promoted experiences of being able to study when the time and the mood of the student were right for studying and made it possible to pause and let the student s thoughts to mature. Own space promoted concentration and informal studying experiences. It provided the students with the experience of having their own place in which to think deeper without disturbances from the classroom or peer students. Own face triggered experiences of daring to having private, personal thoughts among the students about their learning. The human and tool mediators are the traditional mediators connected to the learning context and pedagogical idea of the course. They are, to an extent, uncontrollable by the student. The human mediator (online teacher) triggered the experience of trust, guidance, and monitoring. In terms of the tool mediator (tests, tutorial, and diary), the tests promoted students  understanding of themselves as learners, the tutorial helped students to analyze themselves as learners via the assignments, and the diary made students to elaborate and produce thoughts about themselves as learner, which many students experienced as very demanding.   The mediators found in the study increased the students  sense of being in charge of their studies and learning. This study proposes that attention should be given to mediating tools and their particular features in web-based learning. Mediators should be offered that encourage learners to take charge, make their own space in learning and carry their personal thoughts without fear of being criticized. The role of the human mediator in web-based learning of self-regulation should also be further developed.   The future research tasks need to focus on learners  experiences of mediation in order to identify the mediators in various settings. Research is needed on which mediators are functional in technology enhanced instruction, it s individual and social learning spaces. Studies are also needed about how technology based mediators can be adapted to the needs of various groups of learners." nohref="" />

Lantto, Hanna
humanistinen: University of Helsinki, Faculty of Arts, Department of Modern Languages
63
This doctoral dissertation examines the role of code-switching between Basque and Spanish linguistic elements in the metropolitan area of Greater Bilbao in the Basque Country. The study consists of four articles and a compilation article. The articles examine bilingual speech from different points of view: variation in grammatical code-switching patterns, the role of swearing, slang and code-switching in constructing an informal register of Basque, language ideologies that discourage and encourage code-switching, and conventionalization of semantic-pragmatic code-switching patterns.   The Basque context of language revitalization has created new divisions between speakers, as the formerly unidirectional bilingualism has turned into a situation where great numbers of Spanish speakers are learning Basque in adult acquisition programs or in Basque-medium education. Basque is still, however, a minority language in the Greater Bilbao area and the bilingual Basque speakers live scattered among the monolingual majority. The effect of these social structures on linguistic structures is examined in two sets of data that were collected for the purposes of this study. For the first set of data, 22 hours of naturally occurring peer-group conversations with 22 Basque-Spanish bilinguals were recorded, while the second set consists of 12 hours of metalinguistic conversations with 47 bilingual Basques.   The speakers use their bilingual repertoire in numerous creative and dynamic ways. Yet some tendencies can be detected. Colloquial Basque in Bilbao is a bilingual speech style that always includes some code-switching to Spanish. There is considerable variation in the individuals  code-switching patterns. Some of the informants, particularly L1-speakers of Basque, use very intensive and syntactically intrusive code-switching, whereas others, especially L2-speakers of Basque, only engage in syntactically peripheral code-switching, such as Spanish interjections, discourse markers and tags. The L2-speakers  purist tendencies seem to have two sources: firstly, the normative setting of acquisition where language mixing is discouraged, and secondly, the general interpretation of new speakers  code-switching as lack of proficiency in the minority language. Some Spanish elements have become conventionalized throughout the speech community as the default option. All informants use Spanish discourse markers, and swear words and colloquialisms are always introduced in Spanish in otherwise Basque speech. Spanish discourse markers seem to have been automatized as conversational routines, whereas Spanish swear words and colloquialisms have become conventionalized because of the domains they are associated with, and because of the lack of these stylistic categories in standard Basque." nohref="" />

With the increasing amount of graph-structured data available, finding interesting objects, i.e., nodes in graphs, becomes more and more important. In this thesis we focus on finding interesting nodes and sets of nodes in graphs or networks. We propose several definitions of node interestingness as well as different methods to find such nodes.   Specifically, we propose to consider nodes as interesting based on their relevance and non-redundancy or representativeness w.r.t. the graph topology, as well as based on their characterisation for a class, such as a given node attribute value. Identifying nodes that are relevant, but non-redundant to each other is motivated by the need to get an overview of different pieces of information related to a set of given nodes. Finding representative nodes is of interest, e.g. when the user needs or wants to select a few nodes that abstract the large set of nodes. Discovering nodes characteristic for a class helps to understand the causes behind that class.   Next, four methods are proposed to find a representative set of interesting nodes. The first one incrementally picks one interesting node after another. The second iteratively changes the set of nodes to improve its overall interestingness. The third method clusters nodes and picks a medoid node as a representative for each cluster. Finally, the fourth method contrasts diverse sets of nodes in order to select nodes characteristic for their class, even if the classes are not identical across the selected nodes. The first three methods are relatively simple and are based on the graph topology and a similarity or distance function for nodes. For the second and third, the user needs to specify one parameter, either an initial set of k nodes or k, the size of the set. The fourth method assumes attributes and class attributes for each node, a class-related interesting measure, and possible sets of nodes which the user wants to contrast, such as sets of nodes that represent different time points. All four methods are flexible and generic. They can, in principle, be applied on any weighted graph or network regardless of what nodes, edges, weights, or attributes represent.   Application areas for the methods developed in this thesis include word co-occurrence networks, biological networks, social networks, data traffic networks, and the World Wide Web. As an illustrating example, consider a word co-occurrence network. There, finding terms (nodes in the graph) that are relevant to some given nodes, e.g. branch and root, may help to identify different, shared contexts such as botanics, mathematics, and linguistics. A real life application lies in biology where finding nodes (biological entities, e.g. biological processes or pathways) that are relevant to other, given nodes (e.g. some genes or proteins) may help in identifying biological mechanisms that are possibly shared by both the genes and proteins." nohref="" />

Anthropogenic actions and climate change greatly affect e.g. carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles in soils. The consequences can differ in various soil types. The changes in soil C and N cycles may also have an effect on adjacent aquatic systems and in the atmosphere. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC), N, and phosphorus (P) loads to aquatic ecosystems in general have caused concern. In this thesis, I mostly discuss soil C and N cycles. To a minor extent I also cover C and N in aquatic ecosystems and in the atmosphere, as they are connected to soil cycles. My study involved two separate experimental areas, a peatland and an agroecosystem. In my peat soil mesocosm experiment, I studied peat profiles taken from a complex with a pristine and a forestry-drained peatland. My focus was on changes in DOC, dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), and ammonium (NH4+) concentrations in soil water as a response to hydrological manipulation. In my in situ mineral soil agroecosystem experiment I quantified gross N transformation process rates in no-till and moldboard-ploughed soils after harvesting.   Hydrology remarkably impacted the element concentrations in pristine peat soil water. An increase in DON and NH4+ concentrations was seen as a response to hydrology, while DOC concentrations were not affected in comparison to control concentrations. However, DOC production in pristine peat, followed by its release into water, was also high enough to compensate the dilution caused by water additions to the mesocosms. These compounds were produced during the drought in the aerated soil layer and released to the added water by physicochemical processes when the mesocosms were rewetted. In drained peat mesocosms, the hydrological manipulation decreased the DOC concentrations, and the DON and NH4+ concentrations did not change significantly.   My agricultural experiment results give some environmental support for no-till over ploughing. NH4+ is a substrate for nitrification, and nitrate (NO3 ) can easily leach into aquatic ecosystems, where it may cause eutrophication. Therefore, the observed higher gross immobilization rate, lower nitrification rate, and lower NO3  loss flux rate in no-till supported this practice when assessing the post-harvest leaching risk. In addition, a lower nitrification / immobilization ratio in the no-till indicated a decreased NO3  leaching risk. Higher post-harvest immobilization rate further supports no-till because it may be beneficial for crop growth during the following growing season." nohref="" />

The complexity of the current world is contributing to an increased dependency on innovative approaches and competences for solving open-ended problems and adjusting to multi-layered work environments. Creative ideation is valued not only in traditional creative fields such as design, craft and art, but also in all areas of work life. In design ideation the focus is on seeing beyond the obvious and developing personal constraints on the design task. Therefore, it can be seen as increasing the creativity in problem solving in general. Ideation is important as it is the basis for the rest of the design process. However, the research concerning design ideation is still sparse in Finland, as previous research has emphasised the entire design process. Accordingly there is lack of knowledge, concepts and definitions of ideation to support communication in designing and design education.   The aim of this study was to understand design ideation and aspects that inspire and guide designers in the idea generation process. The study explored the conceptual and material premises for ideation, ways of creating novel standpoints towards ideation and the nature of the design context. The study used multiple qualitative methods; data were collected from a virtual e-learning database, by interviewing and using a mobile, context-sensitive data-collecting tool. The data-analyses applied qualitative content analysis.   The study explored student teachers  and professional designers  design thinking in the ideation focusing on material resources and materially embodied practices for generating and transforming representations. The findings illustrated that interpreting sources of inspiration requires processes such as the use of analogical thinking and abstraction. In addition, creative ideation is a gradual development of ideas. The designer constrains the design situation through creation of visual-material ideas until a suitable idea(s) emerge.   The findings encourage viewing design ideation as a multi-modal process in which representations are important triggers for ideation. The exploratory process of generating and transforming representations is a holistic making-related activity that is best supported by interaction with peers and different types of externalization methods. The study proposes two objectives that design tasks in education should address. Firstly, the ideation phase should include deliberate practices and a variety of techniques for manipulating representations to develop visual ideas. Secondly, the ideation process should embed meaning-making for personal engagement and exploration to pursue ideation towards wider contexts of learning.

The Jokisivu gold deposit is a structurally controlled orogenic gold deposit that was formed during the Svecofennian orogeny when the Pirkanmaa belt, a turbidite dominated subduction zone complex, was pushed below the Tampere schist belt in the north. The Jokisivu gold deposit formed in a brittle-ductile shear zone and gold mineralization is related to the youngest deformation stage.  The main focus of this study was in fluid inclusions in quartz veins. Quartz grains host fluid inclusions that carry information of the prevailing P T X conditions during fluid events in the quartz veins. According to the properties of fluid inclusion assemblages (FIA), six fluid inclusion types were distinguished. Fluid inclusion types A1, A2 and A3 are aqueous and fluid inclusion types B1, B2 and B3 are aqueous carbonic. Relative chronology of the fluid inclusion types was determined by cross cutting relationships of fluid inclusion assemblages. Relative chronology of fluid inclusion types from oldest to youngest is A1, A2 and A3, B3, B1 and B2 indicating that aqueous fluids came in first and aqueous carbonic fluids followed them.  Microthermometry was conducted for all the FIAs. The melting point of CO2 was generally below the CO2 triple point ranging from -59.15°C to -56.73°C indicating the presence of other gaseous phases that were later confirmed with Raman spectroscopy to be CH4, N2 and even H2S. Raman spectroscopy was conducted for qualitative analysis of the phases presentn the inclusions.  Quartz crystallization temperatures were calculated using titanium in quartz geothermometer (TitaniQ). TitaniQ was well suited for Jokisivu samples because titanium concentrations in the hydrothermal quartz were quite constant. Combining TitaniQ P T slopes and fluid inclusion assemblage isochores from microthermometry and Raman spectroscopy yielded a good estimate for P T conditions of fluid entrapment of 390 470°C and 170 345 MPa. The estimated temperature range is higher than the previous studies have suggested. However, the P T range estimated for Jokisivu is in accordance with the P T conditions of other Svecofennian orogenic gold deposits.  Judged by the mineralogy of the quartz vein - host rock contact, the most important factor triggering gold precipitation in Jokisivu has probably been fluid-rock interaction. Strong sulfidation of host rock reduced the sulfur fugacity and enabled gold precipitation." nohref="" />

Despite major advances in conventional cancer treatments by surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and their combination, the outcome remains partially ineffective against numerous cancer types, for example mesothelioma, lung cancer, and colon cancer. Furthermore, due to resistance factors and the subsequent loss of response, which may occur rapidly during the conventional treatments regimes, new anti-cancer agents, presenting new mechanisms of action and lacking cross-resistance to commonly used therapies, are in high demand.   Oncolytic virotherapy is a promising anti-cancer strategy, and the approval of the first oncolytic virus, Imlygic (T-Vec, talimogene laherparepvec), in Western world by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) has opened up new perspectives for improved treatment of cancer. Single therapy is rarely successful in treating cancer, particularly in metastatic or advanced cancer, and survival rates with monotherapies alone are generally poor. The combination of multiple therapies to treat cancer has already shown significant results in the standard care of cancer. This strategy utilizes the combination of both conventional and novel therapies that can bring the future promise of cancer treatment.   In this thesis it has been hypothesized that by combining oncolytic adenoviruses (oAd) with chemotherapeutic drugs and a biological agent we could improve anti-cancer efficacy through synergistic effect against cancer. Therefore, we have tested various treatment regimes with the overall goal being the improvement of oncolytic virotherapy efficacy. Secondly, since safety issues concerning gene therapy and viral vectors are tremendously important, we have performed studies on safety issues of adenoviral vectors. In brief, we have evaluated the anti-cancer activity of combination treatment with standard of care (SoC) chemotherapy (Pemetrexed, Cisplatin, Carboplatin) and Ad5/3-d24-GM-CSF (ONCOS-102) in vitro and in a xenograft BALB/c model of human malignant mesothelioma (MM). We could show improved anti-tumor effects when ONCOS-102 was combined with SoC chemotherapy regimens over chemotherapy and virus alone. Combination therapy resulted in synergistic anti-cancer effect improving the therapeutic outcome. In a subsequent study we tested anti-cancer properties of the dipeptide L-Carnosine complexed with an oncolytic adenovirus (virus-L-Carnosine complex). The complex demonstrated improved anti-tumor efficacy both in vitro and in vivo in tested cancer models. In HCT116 colon and A549 lung cancer cells, the virus-L-Carnosine complex presented a higher transduction level and infectious titer over uncoated oncolytic adenovirus. The in vivo efficacy of the virus-L-Carnosine complex was tested in two cancer models: i) lung and ii) colon cancer xenograft mice models. It exhibited a significant reduction in tumor growth compared to other tested groups. Additionally, we investigated the molecular mechanism underlying the effects of the complex on tumor growth reduction.   Safety assessment of viral vectors was performed in animal studies. Extensive studies on toxicity and bio-distribution of ONCOS-102 in Syrian hamsters and experiments in BALB/c nude mice indicated no side effects of repeated administration of oncolytic adenovirus. The side effects were evaluated by assessment of body weight, food consumption, hematology, clinical chemistry, histopathology and bio-distribution.   We concluded that combinatory studies utilizing oncolytic viruses with standard of care chemotherapy and an experimental virus-L-Carnosine complex showed synergistic anti-cancer efficacy, thus providing a strong rationale for clinical testing of such combinations in mesothelioma, lung and colon cancer. Additionally, our studies suggested that adenovirus could be used in future studies for delivery of other bioactive drugs as a novel strategy in cancer therapy." nohref="" />

The purpose of this study is to investigate the meanings of modern day textile hobby crafts for makers who engage with crafts as a creative leisure outlet. The research is embodied in the term unraveling, which conceptualizes the study both as a means to reflect on the meanings of embodied practice, and as a way to open up new perspectives on making. The theoretical framework reviews contemporary textile hobby crafting culture and uncovers how it has found new meaning in recreational leisure, gendered domesticity and individual resourcefulness linked with Do-It-Yourself.   The thesis consists of three sub-studies. The first level of examination is based on interviews with craftspeople coming from different cultural backgrounds, who were asked to talk about how they see the meaning and value of craft making in their lives. Secondly, textile hobby craft making is approached as a collective practice through a study conducted with an open-curricula craft group. Thirdly, the story of a craft-maker-researcher is sewn into the research narrative through autoethnographic cinema in order to create an understanding of the performativity of craft practice from the perspective of a young maker.   The three studies address how hobby craft making opens up opportunities for learning, sharing, community building and self-discovery, and how it materializes experiences of belonging to a social group and nurtures emotional sensibility in relation to one s own being. The studies show that the meanings attached to hobby craft making have many dimensions, and can be characterized as multiple, overlapping, connective, contextual, shifting and conflicting. Regardless of individual differences, there is a range of commonalities shared by the craftspeople, and accordingly, a wider sense of the world, which becomes agreed upon by the people interested in textile hobby crafts. This suggests that as people take up hobby crafting, they become involved in the negotiation of comprehensive strategies for discussing and sharing hobby practices. This implies that a shared view of the world plays an important role in cultivating meaningfulness of one s craft work, as it generates a common cultural interpretation of the meanings of craft as a leisure pursuit. All in all, experiencing personal meaningfulness seems to be the most important reason for taking up textile hobby craft activities." nohref="" />

This dissertation is positioned in the fields of sociology of education, urban sociology and family studies. The focus of the study is on schools and families  lower-secondary school choices in 2010s urban Finland. The study consists of four academic articles and an introductory part, in which the results of the four original articles are presented and discussed in relation to each other. The first sub-study (I) is a literature review, in which the application and transmission of concepts in school choice research in five European countries is examined. The three empirical sub-studies (II"IV) concentrate on how the reputations and prestige of schools and their general and selective classes in the case city of Espoo are constructed in the parental discourse, what sorts of lower-secondary school choices the families conduct in relation to those hierarchies of symbolic prestige, and which factors seem to be interrelated to the success in the competition over certain study positions. The analysis concentrates on the differences in reputation between general and selective classes across and within schools, the constructed urban spaces of school choice, and families  choices. The ways in which the educational trajectories of the pupils diversify and differentiate in basic education were analysed.   The data consists of 96 semi-structured thematic interviews with parents of 6th graders. The interviews were conducted during the spring of 2011 in the research project Parents and School Choice. Family Strategies, Segregation and School Policies in Chilean and Finnish Basic Schooling (PASC). The data includes parents from all school catchment areas. The interviews were analysed by applying theory-informed qualitative content analysis. The theoretical framework leans strongly on Pierre Bourdieu s theory and conceptualisations of distinction. The analysis focuses on how the conducted school choices relate to families  possession of different forms and combinations of cultural, social and economic capital and how these processes relate to the symbolically differentiated space of school choice. The study deals with who chooses, what is chosen, and especially with how and why. The parental discourse on school choice has been contrasted with the noted worry concerning the increase in urban segregation in the metropolitan area, the social and academic school differentiation, and the general condition of the Finnish comprehensive school.   The space of school choice in the city of Espoo was divided into two separate spaces of school choice in the parental discourse: the local space of school choice and the selective space of school choice. The central divide was the pupil selection conducted by some of the schools to their selective classes. The local space of school choice consisted of general classes in schools within the catchment area. In some of the local spaces the symbolic hierarchy of the general classes was non-existent, but in some local areas the general classes across schools had a strict hierarchy. The general class in the bottom of the hierarchy was considered to be a study environment to avoid. The most common way of aiming to avoid the school allocation to those aversive classes was to apply for classes with a special emphasis. These classes comprised the selective space of school choice, which covered the whole city area and did not follow any catchment area borders. The transition from the local space to the selective space of school choice required different forms and amounts of cultural, social and economic capital from the family, and was not thereby equally accessible as an option to all families.   In addition, the most desirable choices for the parents in their discourse were not the classes with elite reputations with high selectivity and presumably demanding teaching. The most desirable classes were often considered to be  good enough  in terms of teaching and learning, and somewhat selective, as long as desirable amounts of social and ethnic diversity existed. Contentment with school was emphasised in the discourse around the most desirable classes. The elite classes were avoided due to their expectedly high levels of unnecessary competition between pupils.   The analysis on the school choices of upper-class families showed how the mobilisable amounts of different forms and combinations of capital strongly impacted the process of school choice. Optimising the school choice of the child in the competition over study positions was interconnected with social capital, as well as with the mechanisms of transforming and transmitting cultural and economic capital from one form to another and from one field to the next. The most successful with the highest numbers of realistic choices were those possessing the most amounts of capital. The role of social capital was emphasised. The success of the upper-class child in the competition seemed to derive from the habitus, and via their shared lifestyles success in the school choice seemed  natural  among them. The social differentiation produced by the practices of selection of pupils were noticed in the parental discourse, and the choice was legitimised by referring to meritocratic selection procedures and talented and motivated children. The cultural capital derived from the field of culture, such as skills in music or sports, turned out to be relevant trump cards in the competition over study-positions in selective classes within publicly funded compulsory education in Finland.   The central features in the optimizing of the choice were the families  capacities to evaluate their own position in the social space in relation to other families in the field as well as to the symbolic hierarchy of the schools. This combination is named as the social space of school choice. The limitations to parental action are urban limitations, caused by the urban structure of the city, as well as the borders of educational governance (e.g. catchment areas). The central notion is that the differentiation of school choices across families (how the families are able and willing to conduct school choices) are related to their possessed amounts of capital also in Finland. Interestingly, these processes of pupil selection seem to guide pupils from different social backgrounds seemingly  naturally  to different educational trajectories already within comprehensive education." nohref="" />

As more and more sequences are submitted to public databases, so will grow more computationally challenging sequence retrieval systems. When for example the UniProtKB/TrEMBL doubles in size annually, the tools used today might not be sufficient tomorrow. Faster and computationally lighter methods are needed for sequence retrieval. This study presents a computationally more efficient tool. The Suffix Array Neighbourhood Search (SANS) tool is a hundred fold faster than the most commonly used tool BLAST.   The sequence databases do not only grow in size but also in the number of different functional annotations they contain. Recent studies have shown that a large number of these annotations are assigned incorrectly. When the error level of functional annotations in the databases grows to a statistically significant figure, better methods and the use of error detection statistics are highly recommended. In the present study we introduce novel methods for weighted statistical testing of functional annotations. Also novel methods for the calculation of information content value are presented. The information content value enables the discrimination of informative from uninformative annotations.   A growing number of functional annotation tools are introduced annually. Since no gold standard evaluation sets exist, it is impossible to determine the reliability of the different methods. The Critical Assessment of Functional Annotations (CAFA) challenge is the first attempt to evaluate functional annotation tools by using  blind testing  on a large scale. The first CAFA challenge included the evaluation of 54 state-of-the-art methods in two different Gene Ontology categories. The results show that there is a plenty of room for improvement in the prediction accuracy of the existing tools." nohref="" />

This dissertation examines the effects of a change in the roles that extra-academic agents have in academic research: they are participating in the production of academic knowledge more actively than used to be the case. The focus is mainly on disciplines that fall under the umbrella of cultural research. Former informants are nowadays often becoming collaborators, co-researchers or co-authors in collaborative or participatory projects, or conducting activist research on their own cultures.   Cultural research is in a unique position when facing the contemporary urge towards more "democratic" knowledge production. In disciplines such as anthropology, folkloristics and ethnology, researchers have always interacted with their informants' knowledge systems and developed research practices for approaching these systems. These practices are presently colliding with new demands that arise from the now common call for collaborative and participatory research.   I focus on normative epistemic questions related to relativistic research practices and to objectivity. When the roles of the extra-academic agents change, the composition of research communities is also changed. An interactive notion of objectivity has recently been defended in social epistemology. It takes a research community as the unit whose objectivity is to be assessed. In the articles I identify shortcomings in the interactive objectivity of the emerging research communities, and develop analytical tools that can hopefully be of use in improving the situation.   As the composition of research communities is changed, the established ways of approaching extra-academic knowledge systems also have to change. The moderately relativistic practice of avoiding the appraisal of alien knowledge systems is no longer as practicable as it used to be. When former informants join research teams in participatory projects, or indigenous activists become activist researchers, they become part of communities whose interactive objectivity can and should be assessed. This is the case even if some or all of the members of the communities are taken to represent, or see themselves as representing, extra-academic knowledge systems. The contributions of everyone belonging to a research community must be met with the same critical attitude, or the objectivity of the community will suffer." nohref="" />

Koski, Katja

53
Staff members' communication strategies determine how individuals with profound and multiple learning disabilities (PMLD) can more fully participate in their community. Such individuals often possess limited interaction skills and may never be able to use symbolic communication strategies. Since staff members are often the main communication partners for individuals with PMLD, achieving successful interaction situations requires that the staff members modify their interaction strategies to meet the different needs of the individuals. However, staff members often fail to do so. Thus, both observational studies and staff members themselves have concluded that communication skills are a professional competence requiring special training. Speech and language therapists (SLTs) working with individuals who have PMLD often provide their service via indirect therapy, which includes giving advice to staff members on how to improve the communication between them and their clients with PMLD. Yet despite such efforts, the staff members seldom change their communication habits. Thus, the aim of this thesis is to understand the process of indirect speech therapy. Specifically, which issues are important for staff members to learn during indirect therapy and which factors support staff members in maintaining the targeted skills.   The theoretical background of this study is based on Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Systems Theory. This theory states that the entire surrounding ecological system affects human development. The interaction between staff members and individuals with PMLD is therefore defined at the level of different sub-systems of Bronfenbrenner's theory. In the microsystem, the communicative abilities of staff members and individuals with PMLD affects how the interaction succeeds. In the exosystem, the interaction is regarded at the organisational level; the values and practices of the organisations have an effect on the interactions between the individuals and staff members. Finally, in the macrosystem, the social values and practices surrounding organisations (eg. laws, structures, philosophy) influence how the organisations provide care to their clients with PMLD and thus shape the interaction between the staff members and their clients. This study tries to target both the microsystem and the exosystem. Therefore, the research interests are in the interactions between staff members and clients with PMLD and in the organisation which provides the framework of these interactions.   The materials of this thesis were collected from a communication partner training programme OIVA, developed by the Communication and Technology Centre of the Finnish Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities. OIVA training was aimed at staff members working with individuals who have PMLD. The data were drawn from a group situation where SLTs analysed the participating staff members' interaction skills and from semi-structured interviews directed at the participating staff members. The SLTs' analyses of the staff members  interaction patterns were analysed both quantitatively and qualitatively. The staff members' interviews were analysed using qualitative methods.   This study discovered that SLTs have contrasting views about which strategies staff members should use to achieve successful interactions with their clients. Even though there might not be one single way of being a successful interaction partner, this variable can be confusing to staff members if they work with several SLTs who offer different professional advice. The participating staff members stated that they had pondered several ethical questions relating to the individuals' sense of belonging in the community and concerning their right to be understood and to understand the communications presented to them. This resulted in staff members starting to ask individuals with PMLD for their opinions about daily life and to act according to the individuals  wishes. Furthermore, the staff members in this study reported a need for more supervisory support to maintain the results of the training and to disseminate the new practices to non-trained staff. It seems that permanent change in staff members' behaviours comes depends on whether the organisation is willing to focus on the selected issues over a long period of time, perhaps for years, and whether the organisation has developed support systems to maintain the benefits of the training.   This study emphasises that indirect speech and language therapy is a complex professional task. The SLTs providing this therapy need more knowledge about the interaction strategies and the thinking habits affecting the interaction between staff members and individuals with PMLD. They also require understanding of the organisational factors which promote the staff members opportunities to participate in indirect therapy and to use and maintain the newly learnt communication skills." nohref="" />

Korkiakangas, Timo
humanistinen: University of Helsinki, Faculty of Arts, Department of World Cultures
52
The object of this study is the case marking of the subject in early medieval charter Latin. The work explores whether and how the nominative/accusative-type morphosyntactic alignment changed into a semantically motivated (active/inactive) alignment in Late Latin before the disappearance of the case system. It is known that the accusative   originally the case of the direct object   extended in Late Latin to the subject function in which Classical Latin allowed only the nominative. On this basis, it has been postulated that in Late Latin the nominative/accusative contrast was (re)semanticized so that the nominative came to encode all the Agent-like arguments and the accusative all the Patient-like arguments. The study examines which semantic and syntactic factors determine the selection of the subject case in each subject/finite verb combination in the Late Latin Charter Treebank (LLCT). The LLCT is an annotated corpus of Latin charter texts (c. 200,000 words) written in Tuscany between AD 714 and 869. The central result of the study is that the Latin of the LLCT shows a semantically based morphosyntactic alignment in those parts of nominal declension where the morphological contrast between nominative- and accusative-based forms is morphophonologically intact. The following picture of intransitivity split turns up: the low-animacy subjects of the LLCT occur more often in the accusative than do the agentive high-animacy subjects. Likewise, the accusative percentage of SO subject constructions is higher than that of A/SA subject constructions. The common denominator of the examined semantic variables is likely to be the control exercised by the subject over the verbal process. Syntactic factors seem to influence the case distribution pattern as well. For example, the immediate preverbal position of the subject implies a high retention of the nominative. The immediate preverbal position of SV(O) language is a canonical subject position where the syntactic complexity measured as dependency lengths is at its lowest and the cohesion of the verbal nucleus at its highest. Thus, a by then already marked nominative form results. The control of the subject over the verbal process (semantic variable) and the cohesion of the verbal nucleus (syntactic variable) may be partly conflated, i.e., both may affect the subject case selection in certain conditions." nohref="" />

This monograph seeks to explain why so little has been gained in international climate politics during the effort-taking climate actions. In addition to the absolute increase in emissions, also a relative failure during the Kyoto period can be observed.  In this context, we can speak of carbon intensity, which is the proportion of emissions to a country's GDP (the amount of CO2 produced per GDP unit). During recent years, the economy s natural decarbonisation trend has slowed down and energy intensity actually increased. Production has become dirtier, and emissions per production tonne are increasing largely because of the rapid industrialisation of developing countries.  The Kyoto Protocol has not met the expectations. Currently, global emissions are at a more than 50% higher level than during the Protocol s reference year, 1990. In the light of current trends and the annual increase in emissions being around 2.5% on average, global emissions have been assumed to double by 2030. In 2030 the EU s share of global emissions will be around 4 %, now it is around 9 %.  The EU has emphasised to have shown leadership with its climate commitments and it is, indeed, on the right path with regard to the agreed reduction targets. The image of the EU s success is altered, however, if we take into account not only production- but also consumption-based emissions; that is increased import from outside the EU. When analysing international trade volumes, we have to conclude that the EU s total emissions have increased. The imported emissions outweigh the achievements in domestic reductions. A fundamental flaw in climate politics is that the measure of success lies in production, not consumption. In practice, we have outsourced our emissions.  When demand in consumption is met by dirtier production coming from outside the EU, it can be said that in spite of enormous efforts the EU strategy does not meet the expectations in mitigating the emissions globally. The EU has persistently emphasised that sooner or later the other emitters will follow EU s example. There is no evidence for this expectation: the big emitters have long since chosen a different strategy as they consider EU strategy  expensive and inefficient. The major emitters favour decarbonising the economy and technological investments instead of emission ceilings. The EU should approach others and it should stop waiting for others to jump onto the Kyoto bandwagon, if it wants to see a global agreement in Paris.  Instead of emission ceilings the climate agreement could be based on  emission floor , scheme which favours clean production without setting a limit for the best performing, least emitting production.  The main environmental problems are caused by overpopulation, poorly planned land-use and over-exploitation of natural resources. Our efforts should be targeted to these challenges too. Poverty, energy shortages, loss of biodiversity, desertification or the problems of developing countries cannot be reduced to a mere climate problem. However, by tackling these problems we can indirectly mitigate climate change." nohref="" />

Kopra, Jaakko

50
Midbrain dopamine neurons exert a powerful influence on behavior and their dysfunction is associated with many neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases, including Parkinson s disease (PD). Dopamine neurons are large, complex and sensitive cells. Hence, their survival and correct function requires coordinated action of various transcription and regulatory factors both during development and aging. Potentially, one such factor is glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). Ectopically applied GDNF is best known for its potent ability to protect and restore damaged dopaminergic neurons both in vitro and in vivo. GDNF-based therapies have been tested in clinical trials with PD patients with variable success. However, the function of endogenous GDNF in brain dopamine system development, aging and disease is poorly understood. Improvement in GDNF-based therapies requires better understanding of the physiological functions of GDNF in the brain.   The current knowledge of endogenous GDNF function remains obscure, mainly due to the lack of proper animal models. The present study investigated the regulatory role of endogenous GDNF in the development, maintenance and function of midbrain dopamine neurons utilizing novel mouse models: GDNF conditional knock-out (cKO) mice and GDNF hypermorphic (GDNFh) mice over-expressing GDNF from the endogenous locus. GDNF cKO mice enable GDNF deletion solely from the central nervous system during embryonic development or later in adulthood, preserving its vital role in kidney development. Midbrain dopamine systems of these new mouse strains were studied with immunohistochemical, neurochemical, pharmacological, behavioral and molecular biology methods.   We found more substantia nigra dopaminergic cells and elevated striatal dopamine levels in immature and adult GDNFh mice. In cKO mice, dopamine levels and cell numbers were unaltered, even upon aging, and regardless of the timing of GDNF deletion. Both mouse strains exhibited enhanced dopamine uptake, while responses to amphetamine were augmented in GDNFh mice and reduced in cKO mice. GDNFh mice also released more dopamine and GDNF elevation protected them in a lactacystin-based model of PD. Overall, dopamine neurons were more sensitive to moderate elevation than complete absence of endogenous GDNF, which suggests that they can adaptively compensate for GDNF loss. This highlights the limitation of broadly utilized gene deletion approaches in analyzing gene function.   Our results indicate a clear role for endogenous GDNF in midbrain dopamine neuron development and function, but also demonstrate that GDNF is not required for their maintenance during aging. Furthermore, the ability of endogenous GDNF to protect animals in a PD model without the side effects associated with ectopic GDNF application suggests that elevation in endogenous GDNF levels may be an important future route for PD therapy." nohref="" />

This dissertation investigates the practice of machine translation post-editing and the various aspects of effort involved in post-editing work. Through analyses of edits made by post-editors, the work described here examines three main questions: 1) what types of machine translation errors or source text features cause particular effort in post-editing, 2) what types of errors can or cannot be corrected without the help of the source text, and 3) how different indicators of effort vary between different post-editors.   The dissertation consists of six previously published articles, and an introductory summary. Five of the articles report original research, and involve analyses of post-editing data to examine questions related to post-editing effort as well as differences between post-editors. The sixth article is a survey presenting an overview of the research literature. The research reported is based on multiple datasets consisting of machine translations and their post-edited versions, as well as process and evaluation data related to post-editing effort. The dissertation presents a mixed methods study combining qualitative and quantitative approaches, as well as theoretical and analytical tools from the fields of language technology and translation studies. Data on edits performed by post-editors, post-editing time, keylogging data, and subjective evaluations of effort are combined with error analyses of the machine translations in question, and compared for various post-editors.   The results of this dissertation provide evidence that, in addition to the number of edits performed, post-editing effort is affected by the type of edits as well as source text features. Secondly, the results show that while certain language errors can be corrected even without access to the source text, certain other types that more severely affect the meaning cannot. Thirdly, the results show that post-editors' speed and the amount of editing they perform differ, and that various profiles can be identified in terms of how the edits are planned and carried out by the post-editors. The results of this work may have both theoretical and practical implications for the measurement and estimation of post-editing effort." nohref="" />

Elastic X-ray scattering is a probe which provides information on the structure of matter in nanometer lengthscales. Structure in this size scale determines the mechanical and functional properties of materials, and in this thesis, small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS and WAXS) have been used to study the structure of biological and biomimetic materials. WAXS gives information on the structures in atomistic scales, while SAXS provides information in the important range above atomistic but below microscale.   SAXS was used together with dynamic light scattering and zeta potential measurements to study protein and liposome structures. The S-layer protein of Lactobacillus brevis ATCC 8287 was shown to reassemble on cationic liposomes. The structure of the reassembled crystallite differed from that of the S-layer on native bacterial cell wall fragments, and the crystallite was more stable in the direction of the larger lattice constant than in the direction of the shorter.   Liposomes were also used as a biomembrane model to study the interactions of phosphonium-based ionic liquids with cell membrane mimics. All studied ionic liquids penetrated multilamellar vesicles and caused a thinning of the lamellar distance that was dependent on ionic liquid concentration. The ability of the ionic liquids to disrupt membranes was, however, dependent on the length of hydrocarbon chains in the cation. In most cases, ionic liquids with long hydrocarbon chains in the cation induced disorder in the system, but in one case also selective extraction of lipids and reassembly into lamellae was observed. The effects depended both on ionic liquid type, concentration, and lipid composition of the vesicle.   WAXS was used as a complementary technique to provide information on the structure-function relationship of a novel biomimicking material composed of a genetically engineered protein, chitin and calcium carbonate, and films composed of hydroxypropylated xylan. The presence of calcium carbonate and its polymorph (calcite) was determined from the biomimetic material. For the xylan films, crystallinity was assessed. In both cases, also the crystallite size was determined. These parameters influence the mechanical properties of the developed materials.   In all cases, X-ray scattering provided information on the nanostructure of biological or biomimetic materials. Over a hundred years after the principle behind X-ray scattering was first explained, it still provides information about the properties of matter which is not available by other means." nohref="" />

The growing number of x-ray examinations being routinely performed on patients using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) and multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) devices have led to an emerging risk of and concern about radiation exposure. Typical CBCT absorbed doses range between 1 7 mGy, and thus values less than 1 mGy can be considered as low dose values. To date, most studies concerning effective dose assessment in the maxillofacial region use anthropomorphic phantoms in combination with thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD). Recently, MOSFET dosimeters have been considered as a possible alternative to TLDs for in vitro dose assessment. The major benefit of MOSFET dosimeters is their real-time dose measurement capabilities. All 20 MOSFET dosimeters were characterized for CBCT photon energy ranges, dose properties, and organ dose measurements using TLD dosimeters (I). The MOSFET dosimeter energy dependencies were evaluated for two photon energy ranges in order to encompass the typical mean photon energies used in dental radiology. Furthermore, the MOSFET dosimeter uncertainty was assessed by repetitive measurements at different doses. The MOSFET angular sensitivity was investigated using dental photon energies and soft tissue equivalent backscatter material. After MOSFET characterization, a dose measurement setup was developed. The setup comprised 20 MOSFET dosimeters that were placed into the allocated grid holes of an anthropomorphic RANDO phantom. The MOSFET dose measurement setup was validated using two different methods: Monte Carlo simulations and TLD dosimeters. The setup was used for organ and effective dose assessments resulting from supine, prone, and oblique phantom positions in the maxillofacial region using a novel cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) device and from two conventional dental CBCTs and one multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) device. All MOSFET dosimeters demonstrated a statistically insignificant energy dependency when using typical dental photon energies. Furthermore, the MOSFETs demonstrated excellent dose linearity and resulted in similar absorbed organ doses to those attained in the TLD measurements. The required low dose limit was achieved by averaging the values attained using eight MOSFET exposures. The MOSFET dosimeter angular dependency demonstrated a 5% standard deviation from the mean sensitivity value. The MOSFET dose assessment setup demonstrated similar effective doses to those attained using the Monte Carlo simulations and TLD measurements. Effective dose was strongly dependent on the vertical phantom positioning and minor vertical changes resulted in dose increases of up to 16%. The dose measurements acquired using the same FOV on all CBCT and MSCT devices 3 resulted in the following values: Planmed Verity CBCT scanner 247 ¼Sv in supine, 192 ¼Sv in prone, and 134 ¼Sv in oblique position, the ProMax 3D MAX CBCT 168 ¼Sv, i-CAT Next Generation 170 ¼Sv, Philips Brilliance 64 MSCT 781 ¼Sv. The results of this study demonstrate that the mean photon energy dose dependency corrections are not required in typical dental energy ranges. Furthermore, averaging eight MOSFET exposures attained typical TLD low dose values. Due to their variation in angular sensitivity, MOSFET dosimeters should always be calibrated in clinical settings for beam geometry and the angular range of the CBCT exposure. Based on the results of the Monte Carlo simulations and TLD measurements, the MOSFET measurement setup constitutes a feasible method for low dose assessment in CBCT and MSCT devices in the maxillofacial region. When using the same FOV and exposure parameters, the effective doses obtained in the supine position were 29% higher (247 ¼Sv) than those obtained in the prone position (192 ¼Sv). When the prone and oblique positions were compared, the observed effective dose in the oblique position was 30% lower. Thus, optimal patient positioning can reduce the dose and subsequently minimize the radiation risks. In summary, the fast and dependable low- dose measurement setup presented in this thesis provides an effective means of CBCT dose assessment using a variety of exposure parameters, patient positioning, and FOVs. Further, the setup presented in this study can be used to test and develop CBCT devices that would subsequently produce lower effective doses. Since radiologists commonly only have access to the radiation output of different devices, they lack the possibility to assess the actual effective dose. Therefore, the setup developed in this thesis can also be utilized to increase the awareness of the lifetime radiation risks amongst radiologists leading to dose reduction" nohref="" />

Kivimäki, Ella

Aerosol particles are one of the most studied phenomena of modern days because their concretion and chemical compositions affect, both directly and indirectly, many aspects of society, for example, human health.  The source areas of the particles affects their chemical composition and concentration and thus it is important to know where aerosols originate. In addition to the source areas of particles, it is important to understand the processes that affect the particles during transport through the atmosphere, for example, wet deposition. The aims of the thesis were to find out the characteristics in the source areas (1) and the effect of wet deposition (2) on the particles detected at SMEAR II (Hyytiälä, Finland) measurement station. Both aims were studied with the FLEXPART model and to study the first aim also the Hysplit model was used. FLEXPART is a Lagrangian particle dispersion model and Hysplit is traditional trajectory model. The both aims were studied with 14 case studies and each case study was studied with 96 hour backward in time simulations. The Hysplit simulations were made for each case study once and the FLEXPART simulations were made for each case study three times.  The 14 case studies were selected based on observation made at the measurement station SMEAR II during the time period between February and April 2014. The case studies were divided into two classes: cloud and aerosol cases and the general characteristics of the cloud and aerosol cases were compared to each other. The extent and location of the source areas between FLEXPART and Hysplit were compared to define to source areas of the particles. The effect of wet deposition in the FLEXPART simulations was studied by comparing two simulation types: with default and with modified wet deposition parameterizations.   The results of the thesis suggest that the measurement altitude, i.e. the release altitude in backward in time simulation, has a significant effect on the source areas of particles. The results also indicates that in cloud cases the particles originate more wider area than in aerosol cases. In cloud cases most of the trajectories come from South or South-West whereas in the aerosol cases most of the trajectories come from North or North-West which indicates that the source area of the particles could be in the background causing different interesting observations. The results suggest that wet deposition has a major role both in the amount of the mass and in the source areas of the particles detected in SMEAR II (Hyytiälä, Finland), especially in low pressure and cyclone situations, i.e. in cloud cases. Also the result indicates that the amount of scavenged mass is much higher in-cloud than below-cloud." nohref="" />

This dissertation investigates the grammar and phonology of Uduk, a language belonging to the Koman branch of the Nilo-Saharan language family. Uduk is spoken by approximately 20 to 25,000 speakers, whose community homeland was in the southern part of the former Blue Nile Province of Sudan. Due to continuing war conditions since the late 1980s, the majority are now living scattered in the international diaspora, as well as in refugee camps in Ethiopia and South Sudan.   The description provides an analysis of the phonology, morphology, and syntax based on thirteen months of fieldwork between 2011 and 2014. Included in the grammatical description are sixteen glossed texts, to help illustrate the grammar in context.   Most major aspects of the language are described and analyzed in detail. This includes the segmental and suprasegmental phonology, nouns and noun phrases, pronouns and agreement marking, nominal and verbal modifiers, verbs and verb phrases, major clause types, and clause linking.   Uduk has a rich phonology; the main dialect of Uduk has 55 contrastive consonant phonemes, 21 of which occur as a result of the secondary feature labialization. There are three contrastive tone levels in Uduk, and seven possible register/contour melodies on a single TBU. There is also a complex interaction between consonants and tone which has given rise to a depressor consonant effect. This is one of the first Nilo-Saharan languages known to have such.   Argument structure and morphosyntax are equally interesting. Uduk has morphologically marked cases for both Accusative as well as Ergative, depending on the constituent order. Uduk nouns exhibit grammatical gender, the assignment of which has nearly no semantic correlations, even minimal ones relating to animacy or biological sex.   Uduk verb forms use polysemous grammatical suffixes which mark either the location of an action or its internal aspect, and spatial deixis and aspect are heavily intertwined. Spatial orientation and location thus form a fundamental part of basic verbal inflectional categories.   In addition to morphological marking on the basic verb root, many verbs additionally carry discontinuous incorporated nouns called Partarguments. Partarguments are typically body parts, and may function either to classify an argument or then to change the basic meaning of the verb.   These as well as other linguistic features make this description a valuable resource for Nilo-Saharan linguists as well as those interested in the typology of African languages." nohref="" />

The aim of this thesis was to synthesize 1H-benz[d]imidazole- and benzo[c][1,2,5]oxadiazole-derived compounds active against intracellular bacterium Chlamydia pneumoniae and protozoan parasites Leishmania donovani, and Plasmodium falciparum, and to find new potent compounds as hit molecules for further development.   A number of issues dictate the importance of the pursuit of this work. First, C. pneumoniae contributes to human health by being a widespread bacterium and causing respiratory infections such as pneumonia. In addition, atherosclerosis has been shown to be connected to the bacterium s persistent form. Second, a neglected tropical disease, visceral leishmaniasis in turn is caused by a protozoan parasite L. donovani and can be fatal if left untreated. Its current treatments suffer from toxicity, poor compliance and prevalent parasite resistance. Third, another tropical disease, malaria is caused by protozoan parasites belonging to the genus Plasmodium. P. falciparum resistance to recent antimalarial drugs is an ever growing and alarming issue, and there is an unmet medical need for new antimalarial chemotypes targeting the different parasite forms present in various stages of the Plasmodium life cycle.   Heterocyclic chemical structures are widely used in the early drug discovery process and in compound screening. At the outset of this study, a series of 2-arylbenzimidazole derivatives was designed to target C. pneumoniae and L. donovani. Further development of these 2-arylbenzimidazoles resulted in a set of 2-aminobenzimidazoles against P. falciparum. Benzoxadiazole derivatives were designed against L. donovani. Facile and general synthesis routes for the preparation of both benzimidazole and benzoxadiazole derivatives were developed.   In order to study structure-activity relationships of the antichlamydial and antileishmanial 2-arylbenzimidazoles, the left, right and central parts of the core molecular structure were modified and different substitution patterns were employed. Antichlamydial, antileishmanial and antimalarial inhibition activities were related to the different structural modifications carried out. Antichlamydial and antileishmanial 2-arylbenzimidazoles or benzoxadiazole derivatives inhibited target pathogens at the micromolar level.   Furthermore, 2-aminobenzimidazoles were studied as antimalarial compounds. The best derivative from this study inhibits growth of P. falciparum (IC50 94 nM) and has a good pharmacokinetic profile. The compound turned out to be efficacious in vivo against P. falciparum upon once a day oral administration.   In this study, selectivity of the 2-arylbenzimidazoles against selected intracellular parasites over free living (planktonic) pathogens e.g.Escherichia coli was observed. This is a great advantage from the antimicrobial drug discovery point of view. In spite of the mechanisms of action of the studied derivatives remaining elusive, it was possible to show in this study that antimicrobial compound design can be successful even in the case of unknown macromolecular targets of C. pneumoniae, L. donovani, and P. falciparum." nohref="" />

Climate change impacts, such as floods and droughts, are a great threat to people living in South-Asia. Rainfall related to monsoon circulation is essential for people in this region, because it is the main source of fresh water. One of the major questions is how the monsoon circulation would be impacted by climate change. The interaction between atmospheric aerosols and the monsoon circulation has been studied with models, but the connections between aerosol properties and meteorological parameters in the tropics haven't been widely studied with in-situ measurements. In this study the aim is to use in-situ measurements to analyse the correlations between the properties of aerosols and meteorological parameters in Maldives. The measurements of this study were done at the Maldives Climate Observatory of Hanimaadhoo. The island is located near the west side of the southern tip of India. The location is unique and representative for as a backround site for measuring the pollution coming from the Indian subcontinent. The instruments used for the aerosol measurements were Aerodynamic Particle Sizer (APS), Differential Mobility Particle Sizer (DMPS), Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS) and Sun photometer. The monsoon and Madden-Julian oscillation indices were used to analyse the aerosol properties during these phenomena. Both the wind direction and precipitation amount change between seasons. From the size distributions of aerosols could be identified that during the dry season anthropogenic fine particles were transported from over the Indian subcontinent to Maldives. During the monsoon season there could be seen the Hoppel minimum in the size distribution which indicates that marine air, consisting of natural aerosols, was passing over the Maldives. There was a small negative correlation between the number concentration of fine particles and wind speed, but not so clear correlation between the mass concentration of large particles or AOD. The effects of monsoon and Madden-Julian oscillation on aerosols and meteorological parameters were also studied. It could be observed that when both phenomena were ongoing, there were less aerosol particles in the atmosphere, but the size of aerosol particles was much larger." nohref="" />

Kemppainen, Antti

Planar curves arise naturally as interfaces between two regions of the plane. An important part of statistical physics is the study of lattice models. This thesis is about the interfaces of 2D lattice models.   The scaling limit is an infinite system limit which is taken by letting the lattice mesh decrease to zero. At criticality, the scaling limit of an interface is one of the SLE curves (Schramm-Loewner evolution), introduced by Oded Schramm. This family of random curves is parametrized by a real variable, which determines the universality class of the model.   The first and the second paper of this thesis study properties of SLEs. They contain two different methods to study the whole SLE curve, which is, in fact, the most interesting object from the statistical physics point of view. These methods are applied to study two symmetries of SLE: reversibility and duality. The first paper uses an algebraic method and a representation of the Virasoro algebra to find common martingales to different processes, and that way, to confirm the symmetries for polynomial expected values of natural SLE data. In the second paper, a recursion is obtained for the same kind of expected values. The recursion is based on stationarity of the law of the whole SLE curve under a SLE induced flow.   The third paper deals with one of the most central questions of the field and provides a framework of estimates for describing 2D scaling limits by SLE curves. In particular, it is shown that a weak estimate on the probability of an annulus crossing implies that a random curve arising from a statistical physics model will have scaling limits and those will be well-described by Loewner evolutions with random driving forces." nohref="" />

New learning environments have opened the boundaries of schools by connecting them with different societal agencies outside schools. In European and national education policies and systematic curriculum contents, entrepreneurship education has been given increasingly significant attention, and entrepreneurship has become a social context or environment of learning. In entrepreneurship education research, only few studies have been conducted in the educational sciences. Researchers have pointed out the need for holistic educational science to act as a complement for business and a non-axiological ´neutral´ emphasis in approaching entrepreneurship and its theory. The present study focuses on entrepreneurship education as a boundary zone between school and society where traditional pedagogical practice is reconsidered as a question of learning theory. The study draws from cultural-historical activity theory and its theories about learning.   As they have largely been focused on the classroom teaching and teaching methods, analyses of pedagogical practice have lacked the societal bond and historicity of the relationship between education and societal practice. To investigate the theoretical foundations of the relationship between school and society, the study addresses two theoretical orientations: John Dewey s philosophy of school and Engeström s theory of expansive learning. Based on their critiques of the theory of education the study contains a case study on entrepreneurship education. The case study was used as a window for context exploration, and it underlines the challenge of educational and learning theory.   The case study material has been collected from the entrepreneurship education course of a high school specializing in entrepreneurship. The material contains both the ethnographic course implementation and interviews, documentary material and an intervention. The data analysis aimed to determine the internal dynamics, mechanisms and contradictions in the relationship between school and society in learning. A learning environment is conceptualized as an activity system. The implementation of its methodological solutions in the research was to investigate the socially mediated pedagogical practice, to explore the boundary object of people who are members of different communities and have a variety of interests, and to explore the school activity by tracing its local origin and by designing its future.   The results of the study are summarized into four theses which direct attention to: (1) the dualist conceptualization of entrepreneurship, (2) the ontology of knowledge in entrepreneurship education, (3) diversity and multivoicedness as contexts of learning in the boundary between school and society, and (4) teachers as agency of pedagogical development. From the epistemological point of view school faces a new paradox in entrepreneurship education: the opening of the school to society carries a risk that society is understood as detached from the practices of societal life and treated as abstract, value-free and ahistorical reality.

The global burden of stroke is huge and increasing despite significant improvements in acute stroke care in recent decades. The indirect costs, such as productivity losses due to patients  inability to return to work after stroke, are a major factor in the accumulation of this burden and are estimated to outweigh the direct costs of stroke.   Post-stroke cognitive impairments seem to relate intimately to functional outcomes and quality of life after stroke, but their role in the creation of strokerelated productivity losses remains uncertain. The aim of this study was threefold: to compare the prevalence and severity of post-stroke cognitive impairments in relation to the severity of clinical neurological impairments; to specify the role of cognitive impairments in patients  ability to return to work after stroke; and to assess the use of stroke-related income supplements and the role of cognitive impairments in supplement use.   A consecutive cohort of 230 working-aged patients with a first-ever ischaemic stroke was enrolled in two Finnish hospitals. The patients underwent repeated neuropsychological assessments in order to describe their cognitive sequelae. Cognitive data from baseline, six-month and two-year follow-up examinations were analysed in relation to demographic, clinical and occupational information on the patients. Cognitive impairments were defined based on the performance of a healthy demographic control group (N =50).   Cognitive impairments frequently appeared among otherwise intact patients. After taking into account other relevant factors, baseline cognitive impairments most effectively predicted the return to work of the patients six months after the stroke. Regarding the use of stroke-related income supplements, atrial fibrillation was the most effective health-related predictor, and cognitive impairments the most effective stroke-related predictor.   The results of the study emphasize the usefulness of early neuropsychological assessments in treatment planning and the importance of cognitive impairments in the accumulation of post-stroke productivity losses." nohref="" />

This study discusses the language, especially the communicative structures, of Greek dialogue epigrams. The central research questions include: Who are the speakers? How are they identified? How does the recipient know when the speaker changes? How is the turn-division implied? What are the functions of the speakers?   In the study, all the dialogue verse inscriptions are collected and divided according to typology that was created for this study and which is based on the pair structure. The most common adjacency pair of dialogue epigrams is a question answer pair, and many of the elements studied here are features of question structures, but other pairs, such as greeting pairs, are also taken into account. The dialogues contain either one adjacency pair (type 1), several of them (type 2) or longer, often narrative units that form pair-like structures (type 3). The types, their variants and features of the language characteristic of each are discussed using examples. Elements such as addresses, imperatives and particles are central to my argument, and speaker roles and pair structure variants are also discussed. Non-inscriptional epigrams are given as parallels for each type, and the mutual influence between them and the verse inscriptions is discussed using examples. The reception situation and possible performance of the epigrams is also discussed, and on the basis of various examples, it is stated that the representation of the speakers often implies the complex reception situation, part of which was most probably reading the epigram aloud.   Epigraphic methods are used and combined, and the linguistic aspect brings a new perspective to epigraphic studies. The comparison of the verse inscriptions and the literary ones contributes to ongoing discussions on the epigram genre and its inscriptional counterparts. The material discussed is mainly from the Roman period, a phase less well discussed in recent epigram studies, and the study thus adds to our knowledge of the genre and the mutual influence between the post-Hellenistic verse inscriptions and non-inscriptional epigrams." nohref="" />

In this study several inorganic-organic hybrids and multiresponsive hybrid polymers were prepared and characterised in detail. Especially the focus has been on stimuli responsive materials but also on nanocomposites based on modified montmorillonite clay. Furthermore thin SiO2-capillaries were modified for electrophoretic separations. In all cases different controlled radical polymerisation techniques have been used.   The modification of montmorillonite clay was conducted by surface initiated atom transfer polymerisation. Clay was grafted with random copolymer of butyl acrylate and methyl methacrylate and the modified clay was further mixed with a matrix polymer with the same chemical composition to create nanocomposite films. The relation of the nanocomposite structure to its mechanical properties was in the main focus. The extent of exfoliation of the clay in the composite films clearly affected mechanical properties.    Montmorillonite clay was also grafted with pH- and thermoresponsive poly(2-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate). The thermoresponsive properties of the resulting hybrid materials were compared to similar homopolymer.   The inner walls of thin silica capillaries were grafted with a cationic polymer, poly([2-(methacryloyl)oxyethyl]trimethylammonium chloride) (PMOTAC). These capillaries were further used in capillary electrophoresis to separate standard proteins, different ²-blockers and low-density as well as high density lipoproteins. The separation of the analytes was not possible with bare SiO2-capillaries but with polymer coated capillaries good separation of the analytes was achieved. Hybrid materials based on mesoporous silica particles grafted with poly(N-vinylcaprolactam-b-polyethylene oxide) (PVCL-b-PEO) were synthesised. The challenging synthesis of these hybrids was performed as a combination of surface initiated atom transfer polymerisation and click reactions. Thermal behaviour and the colloidal stability of these hybrid particles were studied. The role of the PEO block in the colloidal stability of the particles was crucial.   Finally, multiresponsive hybrid block copolymers based on N-vinylcaprolactam and 2-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate was prepared. The thermal properties of these block copolymers can be tuned by varying the chain length of PVCL block. On the other hand the thermal behaviour of PDMAEMA block is highly dependent on the environmental conditions like pH and ionic strength." nohref="" />

Mentha plants are used in pharmaceutical and food industries. The genus Mentha has been classified into 18 species, 11 hybrids and hundreds of subspecies, varieties and cultivars.   The medicinal and culinary properties of Mentha plants are bounded to the composition of polyphenolic compounds and essential oils. In the present study, the polyphenolic and essential oil composition of 47 Mentha plants. Similar profiling was conducted for 27 commercial peppermint tea samples. This was the first more detailed study to present the composition of mint flavourings isolated from 45 candies and food supplements.   For the first time, the effects of peppermint teas water extracts, mint flavouring hydrodistilled extracts and terpenoidic reference substances against respiratory tract pathogen Chlamydia pneumoniae were investigated in vitro. Mentha plants water extracts and essential oils, mint flavouring hydrodistilled extracts and terpenoidic reference substances were tested in vitro for their antimicrobial properties against the potential pathogens Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. The antimicrobial effects of M. × villosa Huds., M. suaveolens Ehrh., M. × gracilis Sole, M. arvensis L. water extracts and mint flavouring hydrodistilled extracts were studied for the first time on E. coli and S. aureus.   The polyphenolics of Mentha plants and peppermint teas water extracts were rather similar. The most abundant compounds found were rosmarinic acid and eriocitrin. Nine polyphenolic compounds were detected for the first time in the plants.   The total content and composition of the essential oils in the Mentha plants and commercial peppermint teas samples varied. The essential oil analyses of peppermint teas showed that three tea samples may contain M. spicata L., different from that claimed on the package.   The isolated mint flavouring hydrodistilled extract content was higher in mint flavoured sugar candies, pastilles and tablets than in chocolates. The three most abundant flavouring compounds were limonene, menthol and menthone.   Peppermint teas water extracts were active against C. pneumoniae. The antichlamydial activity was often related to high content of luteolin and apigenin glycosides. The mint flavouring hydrodistilled extracts and reference substances decreased the infectivity of C. pneumoniae elementary bodies. Antichlamydial activity could be related to the high menthol content in extracts.   Mentha plants water extracts showed antibacterial activity against S. aureus. Essential oils and mint flavouring hydrodistilled extracts inhibited the growth of E. coli and S. aureus. Linalool acetate and (-)-carvone were the most active reference substances against both bacteria.   This study showed that consumption of Mentha plants may be beneficial for human health." nohref="" />

36
When the journals of L.M. (Lucy Maud) Montgomery (1874-1942) were first published in the 1980s, they became instantly widely read, just as her best-seller novel Anne of Green Gables had done in 1908. This can partly be explained by the literary quality and readability of the journals themselves. Not much, however, has been written about these aspects of the journals. Since our understanding of Montgomery s life is largely based on her journals, it is crucial that we take a closer look at what happens in the text. This dissertation is the first extensive study of the literary facets of Montgomery s life-writing   mainly her journals, but also her letters and scrapbooks. With the focus on romance, both as a rhetorical device and subject matter, I explore the way Montgomery writes about her male and female love interests with what I term fictionalisation.   By analysing the ten unpublished journal manuscripts as well as the published versions of them, The Selected Journals of L.M. Montgomery (1985- 2004) and The Complete Journals of L.M. Montgomery (2012-2013), I approach diary as a literary genre. I explore questions such as how editing affects diary writing and its analysis and how literary conventions are employed in diaries. I demonstrate that for Montgomery the conventional romance is often a façade, one that is undercut by more subversive nuances, as presented for instance in the discourse of female intimacy. Intimate relationships with women come out as a more satisfying alternative to the conventional romance plot. Nevertheless, when this material is transferred to Montgomery s fiction it turns into the expected conventional romance between a man and a woman.   Montgomery s self-conscious way of using romance must therefore be seen as one of the main features of her journals and one that may also influence our readings of her novels. Familiar literary conventions found in the diary, from the two suitors motif to the suicidal lesbian, show how aware Montgomery was of the literary and social customs of her time, whether of the 1890s or the 1930s. The use of the motif of the fallen woman, the tragedy of Hamlet, the fairy tale, especially Cinderella, the gothic novel and the satirical diary novel showcase the diversity of Montgomery s art as she recreates the story of her own romances in her life-writing.   Although Montgomery s journal portrays a rather traditional romantic heroine,  the forlorn heroine of a terribly sad life story , in Montgomery s own words, I maintain that analysing her journals in the same detailed way we analyse her fiction expands on our understanding both of her life and her writing. What is more, our understanding of diary as a genre can benefit from what is found in Montgomery s highly elaborate journals." nohref="" />

Lactobacilli are generally harmless gram-positive lactic acid bacteria and well known for their broad spectrum of beneficial effects on human health and usage in food production. However, relatively little is known at the molecular level about the relationships between lactobacilli and humans and about their food processing abilities. The aim of this thesis was to establish bioinformatics approaches for classifying proteins involved in the health effects and food production abilities of lactobacilli and to elucidate the functional potential of two biomedically important Lactobacillus species using whole-genome sequencing.   To facilitate the genome-based analysis of lactobacilli, two new bioinformatics approaches were developed for the systematic analysis of protein function. The first approach, called LOCP, fulfilled the need for accurate genome-wide annotation of putative pilus operons in gram-positive bacteria, whereas the second approach, BLANNOTATOR, represented an improved homology-based solution for general function annotation of bacterial proteins. Importantly, both approaches showed superior accuracy in evaluation tests and proved to be useful in finding information ignored by other homology-search methods, illustrating their added value to the current repertoire of function classification systems. Their application also led to the discovery of several putative pilus operons and new potential effector molecules in lactobacilli, including many of the key findings of this thesis work.   Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG is one of the clinically best-studied Lactobacillus strains and has a long history of safe use in the food industry. The whole-genome sequencing of the strain GG and a closely related dairy strain L. rhamnosus LC705 revealed two almost identical genomes, despite the physiological differences between the strains. Nevertheless of the extensive genomic similarity, present only in GG was a genomic region containing genes for three pilin subunits and a pilin-dedicated sortase. The presence of these pili on the cell surface of L. rhamnosus GG was also confirmed, and one of the GG-specific pilins was demonstrated to be central for the mucus interaction of strain GG. These discoveries established the presence of gram-positive pilus structures also in non-pathogenic bacteria and provided a long-awaited explanation for the highly efficient adhesion of the strain GG to the intestinal mucosa.   The other Lactobacillus species investigated in this thesis was Lactobacillus crispatus. To gain insights into its physiology and to identify components by which this important constituent of the healthy human vagina may promote urogenital health, the genome of a representative L. crispatus strain was sequenced and compared to those of nine others. These analyses provided an accurate account of features associated with vaginal health and revealed a set of 1,224 gene families that were universally conserved across all the ten strains, and, most likely, also across the entire L. crispatus species. Importantly, this set of genes was shown to contain adhesion genes involved in the displacement of the bacterial vaginosis-associated Gardnerella vaginalis from vaginal cells and provided a molecular explanation for the inverse association between L. crispatus and G. vaginalis colonisation in the vagina.   Taken together, the present study demonstrates the power of whole-genome sequencing and computer-assisted genome annotation in identifying genes that are involved in host-interactions and have industrial value. The discovery of gram-positive pili in L. rhamnosus GG and the mechanism by which L. crispatus excludes G. vaginalis from vaginal cells are both major steps forward in understanding the interaction between lactobacilli and host. We envisage that these findings together with the developed bioinformatics methods will aid the improvement of probiotic products and human health in the future." nohref="" />

Kangas, Kaisa
matlu: University of Helsinki, Faculty of Science, Department of Mathematics and Statistics

The starting point for this dissertation is whether the concept of Zariski geometry, introduced by Hrushovski and Zilber, could be generalized to the context of non-elementary classes. This leads to the axiomatization of Zariski-like structures. As our main result, we prove that if the canonical pregeometry of a Zariski-like structure is non locally modular, then the structure interprets either an algebraically closed field or a non-classical group. This is a counterpart to the result by Hrushovski and Zilber which states that an algebraically closed field can be found in a non locally modular Zariski geometry. It demonstrates that the concept of a Zariski-like structure captures one of the most essential features of a Zariski geometry. Finally, we give a non-trivial example by showing that the cover of the multiplicative group of an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero is Zariski-like.    We define a Zariski-like structure as a quasiminimal pregeometry structure that has certain properties. Instead of assuming underlying topologies, we formulate the axioms for a countable collection C of Galois definable sets that have some of the properties of irreducible closed sets from the Zariski geometry context. Quasiminimal classes are abstract elementary classes (AECs) that arise from a quasiminimal pregeometry structure. They are uncountably categorical, and have both the amalgamation property (AP) and the joint embedding property (JEP), and thus also a model homogeneous universal monster model, which we denote by M.    To adapt Hrushovski's and Zilber's proof to our setting, we first generalize Hrushovski's Group Configuration Theorem to the context of quasiminimal classes. For this, we develop an independence calculus that has all the usual properties of non-forking and works in our context. We then prove the group configuration theorem and apply it to find a 1-dimensional group, assuming that the canonical pregeometry obtained from the bounded closure operator is non-trivial. A field can be found under the further assumptions that M does not interpret a non-classical group and the canonical pregeometry is non locally modular.    Finally, we show that the cover of the multiplicative group of an algebraically closed field, studied by e.g. Boris Zilber and Lucy Burton, provides a non-trivial example of a Zariski-like structure. Burton obtained a topology on the cover by taking sets definable by positive, quantifier-free first order formulae as the basic closed sets. This is called the PQF-topology, and the sets that are closed with respect to it are called the PQF-closed sets. We show that the cover becomes Zariski-like after adding names for a countable number of elements to the language. The axioms for a Zariski-like structure are then satisfied if the collection C is taken to consist of the PQF-closed sets that are definable over the empty set." nohref="" />

Children's participation in early childhood education has raised concern and discussion in the international researches lately. Young children have been considered to have lack of participation experiences in early education settings because of institutional policies, social understanding about childhood and perspectives of educators (Bae, 2009; Emilson and Folkesson, 2006; Smith, 2002). Focus of children as active agents of their own development through sociocultural learning paradigm the approach of participatory learning has been considered important in early childhood education and research (Berthelsen, Brownlee and Johansson, 2009). This approach of children's learning views participation as a developing and dynamic cultural phenomenon.   This research is focusing on the educators' perspectives and the conceptions of children's participation in everyday pedagogic practices and is based on a survey conducted in early childhood education in Metropolitan area of Helsinki in 2010. The survey was realized in the VKK-Metro development and research project funded by the Ministry of Social and Health affairs. The participants represented 1114 working teams from 350 kindergartens. The working teams included 3721 educators taking care of 19 907 children. The analytical framework of research is based on an abductive approach conducted with mixed methods. The findings indicate that children's voice was considered important by educators. Also opportunities to make independent initiatives and choices were considered as a right and an item of learning and of developing of skills of participation. However children's chances to participate in decision making process and pedagogical processes were weak because of challenges of children's participation experienced by educators. These challenges were connected to both institutional issues, such as routines and adult-child-ratios, and professional skills and beliefs about children's competence.   According to findings of this research children's participation is understood to include such aspects as having opportunities to have an influence in their learning and the culture of kindergartens, becoming respected and listened to by educators and having chances to practice responsibility and self-regulation. The role of educators as facilitators of children's participation is found essential and the research builds knowledge of children's participation through framework of participatory pedagogy in early education context. Through this framework the challenges of children's participation could be reflected and a culture of developing participation built in co-operation between educators, children and political and social environment of early childhood education." nohref="" />

Juva, Katriina
matlu:  Matemaattis-luonnontieteellinen tiedekunta, Fysiikan laitos
32
The temperature and the salinity fields (i.e. the hydrography) of the Baltic Sea determine the density and hence the stratification and density depended circulation of the sea. These features are affected by the changes in the hydrologic circulation, most importantly by the changes in the atmospheric circulation and in the water exchange with the North Sea.  The aims of this thesis are to study the hydrographical conditions and changes for the period 1971 - 2007 of the surface and bottom layers of the Baltic Sea and the model sensitivity to number of variables. The surface layer is well studied, but on the whole Baltic Sea scale, the bottom layer studies are rare in number. The halocline and thermocline depths are also included, since they provide information about the mixing. By combining the information from the surface and the bottom, the overview for the whole hydrographical state is provided. For the analysis, three hindcast simulations based on the three-dimensional North-Baltic Sea model are used. The simulations differ in the number of vertical layers, initial conditions and the strength of the bottom drag coefficient.  The results show that the vertical stratification is weaker in model than what is observed in in-situ measurements. The simulations differ remarkably in the salinity level and in its evolution. On average, the salinity is decreasing 0.1 - 0.4 ppt per decade except on the deepest parts of the Baltic Proper. The temperature is increasing at the surface and above the permanent halocline on average 0.2 - 0.4 degree Celsius per decade. Large regional differences between the west and east coast of the basins were found. The bottom temperature increase up to 1 degree Celsius per decade was found in the eastern coast of the eastern Gotland Basin, whereas on the Swedish coast the changes are more moderate and during some months, opposite. On the opposite site of the Bothnian Sea and the Gotland Basin, monthly anomalies up to degree Celsius were found for autumn months. In the deeper layers, the temperature decreases 0.2 - 0.4 degree Celsius per decade.  The study showed that the Baltic Sea is undergoing a rapid change. In order to get a more detailed view of the changes in stratification and circulation, the changes in density should be studied next." nohref="" />

Jukko, Risto
humanistinen: University of Helsinki, Faculty of Arts, Department of Modern Languages
31
This doctoral dissertation explores the phenomenon of intertextuality, which has not been dealt with adequately in all its aspects in translation studies so far. The study analyzes cultural-religious intertextualities in William Faulkner's novel Light in August (1932) and its two Finnish translations, Kohtalokas veripisara (1945) and Liekehtivä elokuu (1968).   The study aims at corroborating, by means of an examination of a set of empirical data, the view that adequate translations necessitate, on the part of the translator, a considerable amount of intertextual cultural competence in the field(s) the original source text deals with and that adequate translations thus cannot be secured by the translator s technical or theoretical translation skills only. In addition, the study equally purports to argue, by reference to the two sets of translation solutions made by the translators during their respective Finnish translations, that the religious components of the cultural contents of the novel constitute a set of data which is not fully accounted for in the translations and that the two translations accordingly both exhibit properties or tendencies which are not entirely adequate or even desirable either from a translational or from a cultural point of view.   The results of the analysis of the 30 text passages examined in detail are threefold. First, the analysis is able to establish that the Finnish translators of Kohtalokas veripisara either used the Swedish translation Ljus i augusti (1944) as an additional source text or that they edited the Finnish translation according to the Swedish translation. Owing to interference from the Swedish translation, Kohtalokas veripisara therefore exhibits a tendency to downplay or ignore certain intertexts. Consequently, this method cannot be considered an adequate or desirable translational approach as it inevitably entails some losses of pertinent meaning.   Secondly, another tendency or property whose presence is ascertained in the analysis is that the Finnish translator of Liekehtivä elokuu has somewhat secularized the picture Faulkner paints of the Southern religion in the original text, thus secularizing some of the cultural-religious intertexts related to the American South. Secularization takes place through what might be called an  assuaging effect,  i.e., by turning some of the cultural-religious elements in the novel into more secular expressions in the Finnish translation.    Thirdly, the study demonstrates that neither specific nor general intertextuality seem to exhaust all the intertextual references needed by the reader-translator. A third kind of intertextuality is therefore proposed in the study, called universal intertextuality. By this term is meant intertextuality which refers to various universal aspects of common humanity, in particular moral or ethical issues." nohref="" />

The first line medication for mild to moderate Alzheimer s disease (AD) is based on cholinesterase inhibitors which prolong the effect of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in cholinergic nerve synapses which relieves the symptoms of the disease. Implications of cholinesterases involvement in disease modifying processes has increased interest in this research area.   The drug discovery and development process is a long and expensive process that takes on average 13.5 years and costs approximately 0.9 billion US dollars. Drug attritions in the clinical phases are common due to several reasons, e.g., poor bioavailability of compounds leading to low efficacy or toxic effects. Thus, improvements in the early drug discovery process are needed to create highly potent non-toxic compounds with predicted drug-like properties.   Nature has been a good source for the discovery of new medicines accounting for around half of the new drugs approved to market during the last three decades. These compounds are direct isolates from the nature, their synthetic derivatives or natural mimics. Synthetic chemistry is an alternative way to produce compounds for drug discovery purposes. Both sources have pros and cons. The screening of new bioactive compounds in vitro is based on assaying compound libraries against targets. Assay set-up has to be adapted and validated for each screen to produce high quality data. Depending on the size of the library, miniaturization and automation are often requirements to reduce solvent and compound amounts and fasten the process.   In this contribution, natural extract, natural pure compound and synthetic compound libraries were assessed as sources for new bioactive compounds. The libraries were screened primarily for acetylcholinesterase inhibitory effect and secondarily for butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory effect. To be able to screen the libraries, two assays were evaluated as screening tools and adapted to be compatible with special features of each library. The assays were validated to create high quality data.   Cholinesterase inhibitors with various potencies and selectivity were found in natural product and synthetic compound libraries which indicates that the two sources complement each other. It is acknowledged that natural compounds differ structurally from compounds in synthetic compound libraries which further support the view of complementation especially if a high diversity of structures is the criterion for selection of compounds in a library." nohref="" />

This dissertation examines food education from the perspectives of adolescents  participation and agency. The study builds on a social constructivist understanding of learning and draws methodological inspiration from child-hood sociology. The empirical part of the study is based on two data-sets: Nordic survey data (N=1539) collected in 2006"2007 and data from a qualitative case study (2012"2013), which focused on 9th grade students in one Finnish school (14"17 years).   The dissertation is compiled from four original publications. Articles I and II examine Nordic adolescents  school lunch patterns and their considerations of meal choices in the family context. Articles III and IV examine adolescents  school lunch practices as an educational resource and the challenges of school-based participatory research with young people. The results drawn from the comparative Nordic data-set function as a broader background, against which the results from the qualitative case study are discussed in this summary. The study is based on an interdisciplinary and multimethod research design, and has combined qualitative and quantitative data in an interpretive integration (i.e., a combination of qualitative and quantitative results at the stage of theoretical interpretation).   The overall aim of the dissertation is to explore how adolescents  views on their food practices could be more thoroughly used as an educational resource and how their participation and agency could be better supported in food education. This dissertation concludes that future work on adolescents  participation and agency in food education would benefit from enhancing intergenerational dialogue and from approaching food-related learning as dynamic processes that reach beyond formal schooling." nohref="" />

The dissertation consists of four academic articles and an introductory chapter explaining the objectives, background and results of the study. It concentrates on the variation and change in predicate structures in Tundra Nenets, a Samoyedic (Uralic) language spoken in Siberia. The focus of the study is on the finite and non-finite forms and the concept of finiteness in grammatical change. The study investigates those grammatical categories that show variation in verbal and non-verbal predication or that are results of grammaticalization processes that include changes in non-finite verb forms. The topics of the articles are adjectival words, modal and evidential categories, and the essive-translative constructions in Tundra Nenets.   The data consists of published texts in Tundra Nenets from different periods of time representing different genres, as well as fieldwork material recorded on the Taimyr Peninsula in 2011. The approach is functional typological, and the methodology combines synchronic linguistic description and diachronic explanation of the grammatical phenomena. The linguistic processes are analysed with relation to language use and context, and their development is explained with relation to the synchronic variation in the language and similar structural and functional paths of change in other languages.   The findings of this study complement earlier research by suggesting mechanisms and paths of change for categories whose origin has been hypothesized in earlier studies. The results suggest that non-finite verb forms often serve as a basis for modal and evidential verb forms in Tundra Nenets, but they can also take part in grammaticalization processes that produce nominal categories, such as the essive-translative suffix. At the same time, the study provides syntactic analyses of lesser studied grammatical categories in Tundra Nenets. It also contributes to the more general discussion on finiteness and infiniteness as well as the division of main word classes in grammatical change." nohref="" />

In various fields of knowledge we can observe that the availability of potentially useful data is increasing fast. A prime example is the DNA sequence data. This increase is both an opportunity and a challenge as new methods are needed to benefit from the big data sets. This has sparked a fruitful line of research in statistics and computer science that can be called machine learning. In this thesis, we develop machine learning methods based on the Bayesian approach to statistics. We address a fairly general problem called clustering, i.e. dividing a set of objects to non-overlapping group based on their similarity, and apply it to models with Markovian dependence structures. We consider sequence data in a finite alphabet and present a model class called the Sparse Markov chain (SMC). It is a special case of a Markov chain (MC) model and offers a parsimonious description of the data generating mechanism. A Variable length Markov chain (VLMC) is a popular sparse model presented earlier in the literature and it has a representation as an SMC model. We develop Bayesian clustering methodology for learning the SMC and other Markovian models.   Another problem that we study in this thesis is causal inference. We present a model and an algorithm for learning causal mechanisms from data. The model can be considered as a stochastic extension of the sufficient-component cause model that is popular in epidemiology. In our model there are several causal mechanisms each with its own parameters. A mixture distribution gives a probability that an outcome variable is associated with a mechanism.   Applications that are considered in this thesis come mainly from computational biology. We cluster states of Markovian models estimated from DNA sequences. This gives an efficient description of the sequence data when comparing to methods reported in the literature. We also cluster DNA sequences with Markov chains, which results in a method that can be used for example in the estimation of bacterial community composition in a sample from which DNA is extracted. The causal model and the related learning algorithm are able to estimate mechanisms from fairly challenging data. We have developed the learning algorithms with big data sets in mind. Still, there is a need to develop them further to handle ever larger data sets." nohref="" />

Ihalainen, Toni
matlu: University of Helsinki, Faculty of Science, Department of Physics
26
Quality control methods and test objects were developed and used for structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Emphasis was put on methods that allowed objective quality control for organizations that use several MRI systems from different vendors, which had different field strengths. Notable increases in the numbers of MRI studies and novel MRI systems, fast development of MRI technology, and international discussion about the quality and safety of medical imaging have motivated the development of objective, quantitative and time-efficient methods for quality control. The quality control methods need to be up to date with the most modern MRI methods, including parallel imaging, parallel transmit technology, and new diffusion-weighted sequences. The methods need to be appropriate to those organizations that use MRI for quantitative measurements, or for the participation in multicenter studies.   Two different test object methods for structural MRI were evaluated in a multi-unit medical imaging organization, these were: the Eurospin method and the American College of Radiology (ACR) method. The Eurospin method was originally developed as a part of European Concerted Action, and five standardized test objects were used to create a quality control protocol for six MRI systems. Automatic software was written for image analysis. In contrast, a single multi-purpose test object was used for the ACR method, and image quality for both standard and clinical imaging protocols were measured for 11 MRI systems. A previously published method for fMRI quality control was applied to the evaluation of 5 MRI systems and was extended for simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and fMRI (EEG fMRI). The test object results were compared with human data that were obtained from two healthy volunteers. A body-diameter test object was constructed for DWI testing, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values and level of artifacts were measured using conventional and evolving DWI methods.   The majority of the measured MRI systems operated at an acceptable level, when compared with published recommended values for structural and functional MRI. In general, the measurements were repeatable. The study that used the test object revealed information about the extent of superficial artifacts (15 mm) and the magnitude of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) reduction (15%) of the simultaneous EEG fMRI images. The observations were in accordance with the data of healthy human volunteers. The agreement between the ADC values for different methods used in DWI was generally good, although differences of up to 0.1 x10^-3 mm^2/s were observed between different acquisition options and different field strengths, and along the slice direction. Readout-segmented echo-planar imaging (EPI) and zoomed EPI in addition to efficient use of the parallel transmit technology resulted in lower levels of artifacts than the conventional methods. Other findings included geometric distortions at the edges of MRI system field-of-view, minor instability of image center-of-mass in fMRI, and an amplifier difference that affected the EEG signal of EEG fMRI.   The findings showed that although the majority of the results were within acceptable limits, MRI quality control was capable of detecting inferior image quality and revealing information that supported clinical imaging. A comparison between the different systems and also with international reference values was feasible with the reported limitations. Automated analysis methods were successfully developed and applied in this study. The possible future direction of MRI quality control would be the further development of its relevance for clinical imaging." nohref="" />

25
The central purpose of this doctoral thesis has been to deepen our understanding of the nature of critical thinking by combining theoretical, empirical and methodological perspectives. The concept of critical thinking has a central role both in research on the philosophy of education and in empirical research on learning and teaching in higher education. Although it is true that the philosophical and empirical analyses of critical thinking and knowledge differ fundamentally, the present thesis argues that there are shared concerns between these two scholarly traditions. The thesis consists of four studies, each of which approached this aim from different viewpoints. The methods involved both a philosophical approach and an empirical multi-method approach. The dialogue between the empirical and theoretical analyses offers new insights into conceptualising critical thinking and its prerequisites and extends our understanding of variations in critical thinking.   Based on the theoretical findings of these studies, I argue that normative elements (how things ought to be) and descriptive elements (how things are) are fundamentally intertwined in the research on critical thinking. Therefore, educational research on critical thinking requires both philosophical and empirical approaches and also dialogue between these two approaches. The theoretical part of the doctoral thesis further demonstrates how philosophical research can contribute to the normative elements of the prevailing empirically-based theorisation of critical thinking, particularly by revealing some conceptual inconsistencies within this framework. The research further introduces the notion of fallibilism (human knowledge is uncertain) as a way out. Epistemological fallibilism fits the presumption of critical thinking better than relativism from the theoretical and pedagogical points of view.   The empirical results revealed variation in (a) students  skills and dispositions to think critically, (b) students  ability to adapt their thinking and performance flexibility, (c) the nature of knowledge students consider to be relevant, (d) the knowledge that students use in problem-solving situations, as well as (e) the way students process that knowledge. Based on these variations two profiles were identified: (1) superficial processing or (2) thorough processing. Superficial processing students reproduced information in the problem-solving situation. These students did not analyse, interpret, evaluate or synthesise knowledge, and their reasoning was very poor. They palmed off justification for knowing on authorities and testimonies. In contrast to previous research, the results show that these students did not share the belief that knowledge is absolutely certain or unquestionable. Nor did these students share the view that beliefs accurately represent or correspond to reality. These students emphasised the uncertain nature of knowledge. The thorough processing students, by contrast, evaluated the quality of the information and considered its premises, as well as the implications of different conclusions. They weighed different options, analysed connections between claims, connected related ideas and gave mainly well-reasoned explanations and convincing arguments. The findings also show that the thorough processing students believed knowledge to be tentative and fallible. However, these students did not argue that all knowledge is constructed by human beings nor did they believe that all interpretations, theories and beliefs are equally right. They thus avoided slipping into relativism. The results revealed that both deeply superficial and thorough processing thinking entails problems if it is connected to an inability to adjust thinking or actions to the demands of the task.   This thesis also identified several methodological challenges in assessing critical thinking. The results show that different performance-based critical thinking tests could give completely opposite pictures of a student s abilities. The results further indicated that the group-level analyses could overrun the rich variations in test performance that occurred among individual students. Additionally, the thesis reminds us that the theoretical framework has a great influence on how data are analysed and interpreted. Finally, the thesis argues that one assessment or analysis method is not enough to evaluate the complex cognitive processes of critical thinking. Instead of a sole focus on empirical or theoretical elements, more communication between the theoretical, empirical and methodological perspectives is required to deepen the understanding of critical thinking among students of higher education.

Currently the majority of space-based assets are located inside the Earth's magnetosphere where they must endure the effects of the near-Earth space environment, i.e. space weather, which is driven by the supersonic flow of plasma from the Sun. Space weather refers to the day-to-day changes in the temperature, magnetic field and other parameters of the near-Earth space, similarly to ordinary weather which refers to changes in the atmosphere above ground level. Space weather can also cause adverse effects on the ground, for example, by inducing large direct currents in power transmission systems.  The performance of computers has been growing exponentially for many decades and as a result the importance of numerical modeling in science has also increased rapidly. Numerical modeling is especially important in space plasma physics because there are no in-situ observations of space plasmas outside of the heliosphere and it is not feasible to study all aspects of space plasmas in a terrestrial laboratory. With the increasing number of computational cores in supercomputers, the parallel performance of numerical models on distributed memory hardware is also becoming crucial.  This thesis consists of an introduction, four peer reviewed articles and describes the process of developing numerical space environment/weather models and the use of such models to study the near-Earth space. A complete model development chain is presented starting from initial planning and design to distributed memory parallelization and optimization, and finally testing, verification and validation of numerical models. A grid library that provides good parallel scalability on distributed memory hardware and several novel features, the distributed cartesian cell-refinable grid (DCCRG), is designed and developed. DCCRG is presently used in two numerical space weather models being developed at the Finnish Meteorological Institute. The first global magnetospheric test particle simulation based on the Vlasov description of plasma is carried out using the Vlasiator model. The test shows that the Vlasov equation for plasma in six-dimensionsional phase space is solved correctly by Vlasiator, that results are obtained beyond those of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) description of plasma and that global magnetospheric simulations using a hybrid-Vlasov model are feasible on current hardware. For the first time four global magnetospheric models using the MHD description of plasma (BATS-R-US, GUMICS, OpenGGCM, LFM) are run with identical solar wind input and the results compared to observations in the ionosphere and outer magnetosphere. Based on the results of the global magnetospheric MHD model GUMICS a hypothesis is formulated for a new mechanism of plasmoid formation in the Earth's magnetotail." nohref="" />

Holopainen-Mantila, Ulla

23
Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is a globally important grain crop. The composition and structure of barley grain is under genotypic and environmental control during grain development, when storage compounds (mainly starch and protein), are accumulated. Grain structure plays a significant role in malting and feed- and food-processing quality of barley. Hordeins, the major storage proteins in barley grains, are centrally located in the endosperm forming a matrix surrounding starch granules, but their role in the structural properties of barley grain is not completely understood. Thus, the main aim of the current study was to demonstrate the role of hordeins in barley grain structure. The dependence of the grain structure on the growth environment, in particular with respect to day-length and sulphur application relevant to northern growing conditions, was studied. The effects of the grain structure on end use properties in milling as well as in hydration and modification during malting were characterized.   The longer photoperiod typical to latitudes in Southern Finland resulted in a C hordein fraction, entrapped by aggregated B and D hordeins, being more deeply located in the endosperm of barley cultivar Barke. Thus the impact of the growing environment on hordein deposition during grain filling was observed both at the tissue and subcellular level. However, the mechanism behind the differential accumulation of C hordein remains unclear. The deeper localization of entrapped C hordein was linked to improved hydration of grains during malting in three barley cultivars. Thus, the role of the subaleurone region in barley grain was found to be significant with respect to end use quality. Moreover, the results suggest that the growing environment affects the end-use properties of barley and that especially the northern growing conditions have a positive impact on barley processing quality.   The influence of sulphur application on hordein composition in the Northern European growing conditions was demonstrated for the first time. Asparagine and C hordein served as nitrogen storage pools when the S application rate was lower than 20 mg S / kg soil, whereas total hordein and B hordein contents increased with higher S application rates. The current study also showed that even when sulphur is sufficiently available in field conditions, the hordein composition may react to sulphur application. The observed sulphur responses were in accordance with those reported earlier for hordein composition. This indicates that the more intensive growth rhythm induced in northern growing conditions does not alter greatly the effect of sulphur on grain composition.   The current study confirmed that the main grain components: starch, protein and ²-glucan, influence grain processing properties including milling, hydration and endosperm modification. However, their influence on endosperm texture (hardness or steeliness), which also affects the performance of barley grains in these processes, cannot be directly derived or estimated on the basis of the grain composition. The results obtained suggest that hordeins should also be taken into account in the evaluation of the processing behaviour of barley grains." nohref="" />

Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) are multipotent adult stem cells that hold enormous therapeutic potential. They are currently in a focus of intense clinical and scientific investigation. MSCs are a promising cell type for various applications in the field of tissue engineering due to their multi-lineage differentiation capacity. Furthermore, one of their most interesting characteristics is that they possess immunomodulatory properties making these cells an attractive candidate for therapy of several immune-mediated disorders. MSCs are of nonembryonic origin and thus provide a less controversial and technically more feasible alternative for ESCs in future therapeutic applications.   Due to their location on the cell surface, glycans are ideal molecules for identification, purification, and characterization of cells for therapeutic purposes. Methods to reliably and proficiently determine both the change in the presence of a specific glycan structures and the changes in the glycome profile of a cell, are needed. Glycan binding proteins in general serve as diagnostic tools in medical and scientific laboratories. High affinity and exquisite specificity are important factors for their successful use.   The aim of this study was to characterize the glycans on the surface of MSCs in order to find novel MSC specific glycan markers. Further goal was to develop antibodies specific for MSC surface glycans, including the novel MSC marker.   As described in the original publications of this study, we first characterized the glycome of MSCs and discovered that certain specific glycan epitopes are present only in MSCs, and not in cells differentiated from them. These epitopes include i antigen, which was further characterized to be a marker for umbilical cord blood derived MSCs. An antibody against the i antigen was generated using recombinant technology. Antibodies recognizing MSC surface glycans were also generated by utilizing hybridoma technology, using whole MSCs in the immunization.   Taken together, these studies provide information of the changes in the glycome profile during MSC differentiation and describe a novel MSC marker. In these studies, we used two different methods to generate anti-glycan antibodies and emphasize the importance of thorough characterization of the binding properties of GBPs. The information of the characteristic glycosylation features of MSCs, and specific markers especially, can be used to isolate and characterize desired, therapeutically advantageous cell populations for distinct applications. Development of better glycan binding proteins will advance the field of cellular therapy and also the glycobiological research in general." nohref="" />

21
Poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline) (BBL), which may be doped into a p- and n-type semiconductor, has been chemically modified to enhance its processability. In its pristine form BBL is processable only in some concentrated acids and nitromethane/Lewis acid solutions. The corrosiveness of these solvents and moisture sensitivity of the solutions severely limits the possibilities for the use of BBL as an electroactive material in organoelectronic devices and limit the possibilities for its post synthetic chemical modification.   In this work processable BBL derivatives have been prepared using two different approaches i) preparation of block-copolymers by attachment of water soluble polymers on BBL functional chain ends ii) attaching bulky side groups on one of the monomers and using that as a starting material in the polymerization reaction.   Short BBLs of DP 10 or 20 were prepared with functional chain ends and monofunctional poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) or poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) of several different molecular weights were attached at the chain ends. Elemental analysis showed that the extent of chain end substitution varied quite a lot when PEO was used. It was also shown that thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was not suitable to determine the fraction of PEO in BBL-PEO block-copolymers. However, the extent of chain end substitution using PNIPAM was evaluated using TGA. BBL-PEOs could be processed into aqueous dispersions at concentrations "e 1.5 mg/ml by means of ultrasonication, and these dispersions were proven to be colloidally very stable. The dispersions could be used to spin- or drop cast films. At higher concentrations BBL-PEO dispersions were shown to form gels. The reason for the gelling is the packing of the polymer into nano-wire structures which then aggregate into 3D-network. SEM- and cryo-TEM imaging confirmed the existence of wire-type structures. Wire structures and gelation were also observed for aqueous dispersions of pristine BBL. BBL-PNIPAM block-copolymers were found to be indispersible in water with PNIPAM fractions lower than 35 mass %. However, they gelled upon ultrasonication. With higher PNIPAM fractions the polymers were dispersible and did not form gels in any of the studied concentrations. Dispersibility in water and the colloidal stability of BBL-PEOs and BBL-PNIPAMs was attributed to electrostatic stabilization as the particles showed negative zeta-potentials. Dispersible BBL-PNIPAMs were more stable due the high amount of dissociative groups originating from the partial degradation of the amide moieties during the coupling to BBL.   One of the monomers used to prepare BBL, 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic acid 1,8-monoanhydride, was successfully mono- and dibrominated. The bromine was then used as a functional group and replaced either directly with 2-ethyl-1-hexylamine or substituted with azide and reacted with 1-hexyne. The modified monomers were used in preparation of BBL. BBLs bearing either 2-ethyl-1-hexylamine or 4-butyl-1,2,3-triazole groups were found to be sparingly soluble in dimethylsulphoxide and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone." nohref="" />

This thesis studies homogeneous classes of complete metric spaces. Over the past few decades model theory has been extended to cover a variety of nonelementary frameworks. Shelah introduced the abstact elementary classes (AEC) in the 1980s as a common framework for the study of nonelementary classes. Another direction of extension has been the development of model theory for metric structures. This thesis takes a step in the direction of combining these two by introducing an AEC-like setting for studying metric structures. To find balance between generality and the possibility to develop stability theoretic tools, we work in a homogeneous context, thus extending the usual compact approach.   The homogeneous context enables the application of stability theoretic tools developed in discrete homogeneous model theory. Using these we prove categoricity transfer theorems for homogeneous metric structures with respect to isometric isomorphisms.   We also show how generalized isomorphisms can be added to the class, giving a model theoretic approach to, e.g., Banach space isomorphisms or operator approximations. The novelty is the built-in treatment of these generalized isomorphisms making, e.g., stability up to perturbation the natural stability notion. With respect to these generalized isomorphisms we develop a notion of independence. It behaves well already for structures which are omega-stable up to perturbation and coincides with the one from classical homogeneous model theory over saturated enough models. We also introduce a notion of isolation and prove dominance for it." nohref="" />

This dissertation studied the structure of multimodal artefacts, or how language, image and other semiotic modes combine and interact in documents. This places the study within the emerging field of multimodal research, which uses linguistic methods to study the interaction of multiple semiotic modes.   Despite the growing amount of multimodal research, the structure of multimodal artefacts has not received the attention it warrants. Previous studies have been either very detailed or exceedingly abstract, leaving a significant gap between data and theory, which this dissertation attempted to bridge. To do so, the dissertation adopted a data-driven approach to multimodal analysis, addressing the structure of multimodal artefacts, the factors that shape the artefact structure, and the role of structure in the recognition and interpretation of the artefacts.   The data consisted of tourist brochures produced by the city of Helsinki between 1967 and 2008, which allowed a longitudinal perspective to their multimodal structure. A total of 58 double-pages were annotated for their content, visual appearance, layout and rhetorical organisation, and compiled into an XML-based multimodal corpus. To study the corpus, the dissertation developed visualisation methods that combined information from multiple analytical layers of the corpus to represent the multimodal structures in the data.   The study revealed the functional motivation behind the structure of the tourist brochures, identifying patterns in their hierarchical and rhetorical organisation, which were used to fulfil specific communicative tasks. The configuration of these patterns, in turn, signalled how the brochure was to be interpreted. The results also showed that after the year 1985, which marked the introduction of desktop publishing software, the organising principles of the tourist brochures have shifted towards a more fragmented and non-linear structure." nohref="" />

After the finding of a Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider of CERN, the next milestone in experimental particle physics is the detection of a new particle beyond the Standard Model. Many of the popular extensions of the Standard Model are so called Two-Higgs-doublet models, that include five physical Higgs bosons in total. Two of the bosons are neutral scalars, two are charged scalars and one is a pseudoscalar.  The first part of this thesis presents the Standard Model of particle physics as a gauge field theory where the gauge principle is used to introduce interactions between the particles. Quantum electrodynamics, weak interactions and quantum chromodynamics with their properties are discussed. The electroweak symmetry breaking through the Higgs mechanism and its implications for the masses of the particles are shown. The considerations on the Standard Model are concluded by discussing some of the problems in the Standard Model.  Supersymmetric extensions to the Standard Model are introduced, motivated by their potential to solve some of the problems and by the framework for new physics the supersymmetry provides. The Higgs sector in the more constrained minimal supersymmetry scenario is discussed and some of the properties for these new Higgs bosons are given.  The latter part of the thesis focuses on the experimental aspects of high energy particle physics. The search for the charged Higgs boson in the $H^+\\rightarrow\\tau^+\ u_\\tau$ decay channel, with the tau lepton decaying into hadronic decay products is presented in detail. Vetoing collision events with more than one tau particle is shown to enhance the transverse mass resolution of the analysis, improving the signal detection. Methods for performing a tau veto are discussed and the problems in performing the tau veto are studied using 13 TeV collision event simulations and data from 2015 from the CMS detector at the LHC. No viable way of performing the tau veto in such a way that it improves the overall analysis is found." nohref="" />

Intermolecular interactions are ubiquitous, and their intricate network plays a decisive role in most of the phenomena encountered in our everyday lives. The focus of this thesis is on the London dispersion forces, a component present in all interactions between atoms and molecules, and often the most important one at long intermolecular distances. The quantum-mechanical origin of these forces can be traced to the correlated fluctuations of the molecular charge distributions, which however render the dispersion interactions challenging to calculate accurately, due to the high-level electronic structure methods required. The aim of the research presented in this thesis is to investigate the dispersion interactions, and to develop a viable method for modeling them.   The systems studied in the accompanying research articles mainly encompass small clusters of coinage (Cu, Ag, and Au) and volatile (Zn, Cd, and Hg) metals. The long-range forces present in these clusters are calculated by means of highly correlated electronic structure methods, and the interaction potentials are used to develop a simple but effective model, capable of accurately describing the dispersion interactions in a variety of systems. Some original theoretical considerations are also elaborated. A novel formula is derived for the tensor describing all intermolecular interactions, and it is applied to investigate the long-range interaction potential of coinage metal hydrogen clusters.   The method developed to account for the dispersion energy is a pair-potential model, where the total intermolecular London forces are calculated by means of atomic dispersion coefficients describing the magnitude and orientation dependence of the interaction. The coefficients are calculated based on small model systems, and they are used to compute the dispersion energy in larger clusters at no additional cost. Encouraging results are also obtained for the computed orientation averaged interaction potentials. All things considered, the publications included in this thesis indicate that the methods proposed and implemented to analyze the studied systems are capable of accurately modeling the non-covalent forces in a straightforward fashion." nohref="" />

This study examines the lived experiences of oppression and opportunities encountered by Tibetan Buddhist nuns. The theoretical approach of the research is intersectionality, which aims at describing and analyzing the interconnection of different oppressive status positions and institutions and giving voice to marginalized groups. My study investigates how the intersections of the nuns  female gender, their Buddhist religion and their Tibetan nationality on the one hand produce subordination and an unequal distribution of power and, on the other hand, provide the nuns with opportunities and agency.   The study is based on research material collected during three field research trips to the traditionally Tibetan regions of Amdo and Kham in the People s Republic of China, and one trip to a Tibetan exile community in Himachal Pradesh in India. The data was collected through multi-sited ethnography. The primary material comprises the life story interviews of 38 nuns. In addition, 49 focused and semi-structured interviews with lay Tibetans and some monks and nuns were conducted and thematically analyzed in order to gain more information about the significance of Tibetan monasticism in the present-day Tibetan society.   The analysis shows that power structures and relations that disadvantage nuns as women, as religious practitioners, and as Tibetans are constructed and maintained in different domains of power. In the structural domain, traditional but still dominant institutions   such as the distribution of work, marriage and educational practices, as well as religious institutions   disadvantage Tibetan nuns. In the disciplinary domain of power, the nuns find themselves monitored by traditional culture and the Chinese authorities. The unequal distribution of power in these domains is justified by hegemonic ideas based on religious and cultural beliefs, ideas of religion and modernity, and religion and gender. These domains of power find their expression in the everyday life of people in the interpersonal sphere.   Moreover, the analysis also reveals that many of the nuns were highly active in choosing and determining their life course. It can be suggested that monastic life offers Tibetan women freedom from the suffering faced by laywomen. The juncture of their gender, religion and nationality also provides them with agency that can be understood as resistance. This becomes most evident in their nationalism, which is both visible and more subtle. Finally, monastic life offers them religious agency as compassionate bodhisattvas, who aim to not only benefit other living beings but also themselves. The research shows that depending on the intersection of her status positions, the Tibetan nun can be either disadvantaged or privileged, or in some cases, both at the same time." nohref="" />

Viruses are the most abundant replicating entities on Earth, and they infect cells from all three domains of life - where there are cells, there are viruses. Extremophilic organisms and viruses thrive in hostile environments including hot, acidic springs, oceanic hydrothermal vents, and salt lakes. Due to their adaptation to extreme environments, these organisms and their viruses have been exploited for enzymes useful for industrial and biotechnological applications. Such enzymes include starch processing, cellulose degrading, proteolytic and DNA-processing enzymes. The latter ones are used in molecular biology applications such as polymerase chain reactions and DNA-sequencing.   The aim of this study was to characterize novel, extremophilic viruses living in hot springs. I solved the three dimensional structure of two such viruses using electron cryo-microscopy and three dimensional image reconstruction, and explored the presence of extremophilic enzymes based on their genome sequence. One of the viruses characterized in this study is P23-77 that infects the thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus living in alkaline hot springs. P23-77 has been proposed to belong to the Tectiviridae family of viruses characterized by an internal lipid bilayer surrounded by an icosahedral protein capsid. The structure of the icosahedral P23-77 was initially solved to 1.4 nm resolution, and subsequently to 1.0 nm resolution. The reconstruction, together with thin-layer chromatography, confirmed the presence of an internal lipid bilayer composed of neutral lipids. Analysis of the P23-77 protein profile revealed it to have 10 structural proteins, two of which were major ones based on their abundance in SDS-PAGE gels. These proteins were suggested to form the capsomers with hexameric bases of the P23-77 T = 28d capsid lattice. Surprisingly, P23-77 closely resembles the haloarchaeal virus SH1, both of which are suggested to have single ²-barrel major capsid proteins, and together forming a novel viral lineage.   The other virus characterized in this study is the Sulfolobus turreted icosahedral virus 2 (STIV2) infecting the crenarchaeon Sulfolobus islandicus that lives in acidic hot springs. The genome of STIV2 was sequenced, and some of its structural proteins were determined by mass-peptide fingerprinting. The structure of STIV2 was solved to 2.0 nm resolution. The genome sequence and the structure of STIV2 revealed it to resemble most closely STIV, infecting S. solfataricus. Like P23-77, both STIV and STIV2 have an outer protein capsid surrounding the internal lipid bilayer and the double-stranded (ds) DNA genome. The most striking difference between STIV and STIV2 resides in the host-cell recognition and attachments structures, which in STIV2 lacks the petal-like appendages present in STIV. Based on difference imaging, homology modeling and comparison to STIV, a model for the organization of the STIV2 virion was proposed. Furthermore, based on sequence data and homology modeling I identified the postulated genome packaging NTPase B204 of STIV2. I expressed and purified B204, and studied the nucleotide hydrolysis catalyzed by it. I furthermore solved four structures of B204   more precisely, in complex with a sulphate ion, adenosine monosphosphate, the product adenosine diphosphate, and the substrate analogue adenylylmethylenediphosphonate. B204 is the first genome packaging NTPase of a membrane-containing virus for which the structure has been solved. Based on the structure of B204, comparison to other known DNA-translocating enzymes, and other genome packaging NTPases of dsDNA and dsRNA viruses, I propose a model for the genome packaging of STIV2." nohref="" />

Toxic and incapacitating chemicals are ubiquitous in everyday life. Despite the prohibition of chemical weapons by the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), many toxic chemicals are still used: as legal riot control agents, in various processes and products of the chemical industry or as pesticides in agriculture. Validated analytical methods and knowledge of metabolism are therefore needed for the verification of possible intentional or unintentional exposures in carrying out occupational tasks or in civil incidents.   The most reliable retrospective detection and confirmation of exposure to chemicals are achieved by analyzing unequivocal metabolites such as biomarkers, from biological samples, which have mainly been obtained from exposed persons, animals and experimental animal models. However, the use of animal testing for evaluating the safety and effects of chemicals that are known to be toxic or incapacitating raises ethical questions. Therefore, the use of an in vitro metabolism study approach to predict in vivo metabolite profiles, prior to obtaining more detailed knowledge in vivo could be a preferable strategy for evaluating the toxicology of these chemicals.   Four toxic and incapacitating chemicals listed in the CWC or used for riot control were studied in this thesis, namely: sulfur mustard, capsaicinoids, chloropicrin and saxitoxin. The suitability of the conventional in vitro metabolism studies were assessed in this research. These assessments were achieved by using various mass spectrometric (MS) methods to screen and identify the formed metabolites. The validations of analyses methods for known biomarkers were carried out according to the current bioanalytical validation guidelines and identification criteria.   The conventional in vitro metabolism studies used for sulfur mustard, capsaicinoids and chloropicrin, yielded new knowledge about the metabolic reactions and produced several novel metabolites by oxidative reactions and GSH conjugation. However, their clinical usefulness to serve as biomarkers of exposure in humans requires further studies. Quantitative fit for purpose analysis methods were optimized and validated for the following chemicals: saxitoxin, two b-lyase metabolites of sulfur mustard, and nitromethane as a metabolite of chloropicrin. All methods were found to be accurate and linear and fulfilled the general identification criteria." nohref="" />

This dissertation examines factors that distinguish an international English-medium instruction (EMI) teacher education programme from mainstream teacher education programmes. International teacher education is understood in this study as a transdisciplinary programme that is taught in English as a lingua franca (ELF) and that admits both international and domestic students. The students thus originate from different backgrounds and they are not all familiar with the local school system. The programme is mostly taught by teacher educators educated in the local context. This study explores student teachers  and teacher educators  conceptions and experiences of and adjustment to multiculturalism and English as a lingua franca in a Finnish university context. The purpose of this dissertation is to investigate the roles that these factors play in implementing an international subject teacher education programme within the context of local (teacher) education.   This PhD study consists of five separate but interrelated studies that together form a more holistic picture of the phenomena studied. The five sub-studies examine the phenomena from different perspectives and aim at highlighting issues that are important for programme development. The sub-studies use various data collection methods: interviews, focus groups, student course work, questionnaires, and an excerpt from a recorded lecture. The data analysis methods consist of discursive pragmatics, thematic analysis and qualitative content analysis.   As its theoretical contribution this study weaves together the four factors of internationalization, interculturality (including the inclusion of immigrant teachers in local schools as an intercultural phenomenon), transdisciplinarity and English as a lingua franca, and conceptualizes their interrelations. On the one hand, this study reveals the complexity of constructing an international teacher education programme. On the other hand, the study provides a model for supporting teaching and learning in the context of international, transdiscipinary teacher education in order for it to serve the needs and demands of today s students, teachers, institutions and societies." nohref="" />

Betulin is a triterpene class natural product present, for example, in the outer layer of birch bark, which is a low-value waste product of the forestry industry in Northern Hemisphere. Oxidation products of betulin, namely betulinic acid and betulonic acid, have been shown to have several biological activities. This makes betulin an interesting starting point for drug discovery projects.   In this work, mainly ring A-fused heterocyclic derivatives of betulin were synthesized, and their structure-activity relationships against a protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani, prostate cancer cell lines, a serine hydrolase enzyme (ABHD12), and inflammatory factors were studied. The heterocycles used included pyridine, pyrazine, pyrazole, indole, isoxazole, and oxazole rings. Also, positions C-28 and C-20 of these compounds were modified and the resulting structure-activity relationships (SAR) were studied.   Among the tested compounds, two heterocyclic betulin derivatives showed significant inhibition against L. donovani amastigotes growth. These compounds showed improved activity compared to the heterocyclic betulin derivatives tested previously. Also, a betulinderived potent anti-HIV compound, bevirimat, showed L. donovani growth inhibition at a similar level to the ring A-fused heterocyclic betulin derivatives. However, further optimization is needed to get more potent betulin derivative activity against L. donovani.   In prostate cancer studies some of the betulin derivatives displayed dose-dependent anti-invasive activity at nanomolar concentrations with negligible cytotoxicity. The most potent compounds were betulin derivatives with a ring A-fused heterocycle. Also, the carboxyl group at C-28 seemed to be important for activity. These compounds showed considerably improved anti-invasive effects compared to betulinic acid.   Betulin derivatives were found to selectively inhibit the ABHD12 serine hydrolase enzyme without inhibiting other endocannabinoid hydrolases and without activity towards cannabinoid receptors. In mechanistic studies, the inhibition type was shown to be reversible. Important structural features required for ABHD12 inhibition were revealed based on our SAR studies.   Heterocyclic betulin derivatives were shown to suppress the expression of several inflammation mediators, such as iNOS, IL-6, and MCP-1, a pyrazole derivative being the most potent compound. With further improvement and development, more potent betulin derivatives could be found.   The betulin derivatives show different activity with different targets, which means they are selective. Selectivity and potency could be further improved to obtain a potential betulin-derived compound for further development. In this work, betulin has been shown to be a good starting point for several different drug discovery projects." nohref="" />

Both the ability to gain a high dominance status and having an efficient immune defence are favourable qualities that typically increase fitness in social and host-parasite interactions. Individuals with a high dominance status are predicted to gain fitness-related benefits from prior access to limited, defensible resources, such as food and matings. Immune defence mechanisms, on the other hand, have evolved to minimize the fitness costs of parasitic infections. The relative significance of a high dominance status and strong immune defence for individual fitness is, however, affected by the quality of the environment.   The aim of this thesis is to improve the understanding of environmentally determined variation in dominance status, immune defence and their consequences for individual fitness. I use the native noble crayfish (Astacus astacus), the invasive signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) and the highly virulent, invasive Aphanomyces astaci, the causative agent of the crayfish plague, as my study models. I first experimentally test theoretical predictions on how major ecological factors, including food availability, predation risk and population density, influence behavioural decision-making in fight contests, especially with regard to the maintenance of dominance hierarchies between size-matched crayfish. Using natural noble crayfish subpopulations with different crayfish plague history, I then explore whether variation in immune defence and crayfish plague resistance is potentially explained by local adaptation to the disease, or alternatively by geographical divergence. By keeping noble crayfish experimentally under constant environmental conditions, I finally determine whether seasonal variation in immune defence is endogenously regulated.   My results show that individuals that had achieved dominant status in non-resource fight contests have an advantage in monopolising a limited, defendable food resource in a future contest. Furthermore, I find evidence that as population density increases, the division of the resource between dominants and subdominants becomes more unequal. Generally, my results suggest that due to ecological factors the dominance status of individuals can be more dynamic than theory predicts, especially when the contestants have similar fighting ability. For example, in line with the asset-protection principle, individuals having achieved dominant status in a non-predation risk contest increase their submissive behaviours in the presence of a predation threat, giving subdominants the opportunity to win a larger percentage of bouts in the predation risk contest. My results also reveal evidence for geographical variation in resistance to the crayfish plague and immune defence that is, however, independent of historical disease outbreaks in the study subpopulations. Furthermore, for the first time in invertebrates, my results demonstrate reproduction-related endogenous seasonal variation in the immune defence of noble crayfish.   Overall, my results suggest that ecological factors, such as population density, predation risk and disease history, have to be taken in to account to better understand the causes and consequences of dominance status and immune defence in any individual species." nohref="" />

The need for energy and electricity in the modern society places large interest in producing power in more efficient and environmentally friendly ways. Most of the new concepts also need new or improved materials. One key component of the power plants is the structural materials. Both current and future power plants are and will be built from some kinds of steel, which has shown very good properties. Alloying and choice of manufacturing technique have been shown to change the properties of steel and even better materials have been obtained. Conventionally, these improvements have been studied by conducting experiments on the possible materials, but recently computer simulations have started to be an essential tool in the search for better materials.   The mechanical properties of materials are known to be determined by the movement of dislocations. If the dislocation movement is hindered, the material will become harder, but also more brittle. Previous computational studies have investigated the effect of voids, bubbles and other dislocation structures on the movement of dislocations. However, the effect of non-coherent obstacles, man-made or irradiation induced, have received much less attention. To address this lack of data, we have investigated the effect of carbides, to represent non-coherent obstacles, on the dislocation movement.   In this study we investigated different carbides and compared them with other defect structures, voids and fixed atoms. The effect of size and temperature were also determined. We obtained two parameters for each obstacle, the needed unpinning stress and the unpinning mechanism, that can be used in other simulation methods to be able to investigate larger systems. We found that the nanostructure of the obstacle can drastically change the needed unpinning stress. We also found that the obstacles with same unpinning mechanism showed similar unpinning stresses, but to obtain the subtle differences we need to consider the nanostructure. A comparison of spherical and rod shaped obstacles showed that the surface curvature will be an important factor in the unpinning event.   Recently, a new class of metal alloys have been found, where the concentrations of the alloying elements are in large or equal fractions. We wanted to investigate the possibility to use these equiatomic multicomponent alloys in environments where radiation is present. These alloys have been shown to have very promising properties, but there were no data on the irradiation response of these alloys. We studied two equiatomic multicomponent alloys, two-element and three-element alloys, and compared them with the single element specimen. We found a major reduction of defect build-up in the alloys compared to the single element sample, in agreement with experiments. We found one of the key mechanisms of this reduction to be the reduced dislocation mobility in the alloys." nohref="" />

Alcohol dependence and alcoholism are modulated by environmental factors and genetic predisposition. Rat models have been invaluable in the investigation of several aspects of alcoholism in humans. The rodents exhibit a wide range of genetically determined alcohol-drinking preferences. Selective rat breeding programs with different alcohol preference has produced stable lines of rats that reliably exhibit high and low voluntary alcohol consumption (termed here AA and ANA, respectively).   Alcohol consumption is also strongly dependent on environmental conditions. Stressful events evoke an extensive multisystem and integrative physiological response, where a major component is the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.   Testosterone has been implicated as mediator of the rewarding effect of alcohol, and the testosterone level is predictive of future alcohol consumption. The objective of the present thesis is to examine in greater detail the relations between alcohol, testosterone and neuroendocrine stress responses, and alcohol drinking.   In the first study (I), the interrelations between endogenous and alcohol-mediated effects on testosterone and corticosterone levels and voluntary alcohol consumption were studied in a crossbred F2 generation of the original AA and ANA rat lines. The second study (II) was a reinvestigation of the effect of subchronic nandrolone decanoate treatment, which in an earlier study had been shown to increase alcohol consumption, and the relation of the effect on the HPA and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axes. The third study (III) examined the possible role of benzyl alcohol, present as a preservative in the nandrolone product used in the earlier study, as a confounding factor that could explain differences between the results of the earlier study and the present one. In the fourth study (IV) the interrelations between the effect of corticosterone on alcohol-mediated testosterone changes and alcohol consumption in AA, ANA, F2 and Wistar rats were examined.   The results of Study I shows connections between testosterone elevation and increased alcohol drinking, as well as between testosterone reduction and decreased alcohol drinking, which is in line with the original data of the AA and ANA lines. Elevated endogenous testosterone levels and higher frequencies of alcohol-induced testosterone increases were found in high consumption groups compared to low consumption groups. In Study II, subchronic nandrolone administration led to a reduction in alcohol-mediated testosterone levels, correlating with reduced voluntary alcohol consumption in the alcohol-preferring AA rat line. On the other hand, Study III showed that benzyl alcohol increases voluntary alcohol intake at least in the low-consumption rats, which may explain earlier discrepancies among studies. The results of Study IV were consistent with the hypothesis that corticosterone is involved in the regulation of alcohol-mediated testosterone changes.   In conclusion, our present results suggests that corticosterone is a balancer, which regulates both the alcohol-mediated testosterone increase followed by reinforcement and increased voluntary alcohol drinking in high-drinking rats, and the alcohol-mediated testosterone reduction followed by disinforcement and reduced alcohol intake in low-drinking rats." nohref="" />

Due to the popularity of smartphones and mobile streaming services, the growth of traffic volume in mobile networks is phenomenal. This leads to huge investment pressure on mobile operators' wireless access and core infrastructure, while the profits do not necessarily grow at the same pace. As a result, it is urgent to find a cost-effective solution that can scale to the ever increasing traffic volume generated by mobile systems. Among many visions, mobile traffic offloading is regarded as a promising mechanism by using complementary wireless communication technologies, such as WiFi, to offload data traffic away from the overloaded mobile networks. The current trend to equip mobile devices with an additional WiFi interface also supports this vision.   This dissertation presents a novel collaborative architecture for mobile traffic offloading that can efficiently utilize the context and resources from networks and end systems. The main contributions include a network-assisted offloading framework, a collaborative system design for energy-aware offloading, and a software-defined networking (SDN) based offloading platform. Our work is the first in this domain to integrate energy and context awareness into mobile traffic offloading from an architectural perspective. We have conducted extensive measurements on mobile systems to identify hidden issues of traffic offloading in the operational networks. We implement the offloading protocol in the Linux kernel and develop our energy-aware offloading framework in C++ and Java on commodity machines and smartphones. Our prototype systems for mobile traffic offloading have been tested in a live environment. The experimental results suggest that our collaborative architecture is feasible and provides reasonable improvement in terms of energy saving and offloading efficiency. We further adopt the programmable paradigm of SDN to enhance the extensibility and deployability of our proposals. We release the SDN-based platform under open-source licenses to encourage future collaboration with research community and standards developing organizations. As one of the pioneering work, our research stresses the importance of collaboration in mobile traffic offloading. The lessons learned from our protocol design, system development, and network experiments shed light on future research and development in this domain." nohref="" />

Development and Validation of a Drug-Related Problem Risk Assessment Tool for Use by Practical Nurses Working With Community-Dwelling Aged   The demand for long-term home health care services for the aged ("e65 years) is growing. Practical nurses (PNs) are those who most often visit the aged using HC services and consequently, are in a key position to monitor the benefits and risks of pharmacotherapy of their clients.   The aim of this study was to develop and validate an easy-to-use DRP Risk Assessment Tool (DRP-RAT) for PNs caring for home-dwelling aged "e65 years focusing on identifying and solving the highest priority DRP risks. The specific aims were: 1) to systematically review articles that describe criteria for assessing inappropriate prescribing in the aged "e65 years; 2) to describe the development process and content validation of the DRP-RAT; 3) to evaluate the feasibility of the final DRP-RAT among PNs in HC; and 4) to assess the reliability of risk assessments conducted by PNs by using DRP-RAT and to identify the clinically most significant DRPs needing action.   Two systematic literature reviews (Study I, year 2010; an unpublished one) and the expertise of the research group were used as a basis for the development of the DRP-RAT. The content of the draft tool was validated by a three-round Delphi survey with a panel of 18 experts in geriatric care and pharmacotherapy (Study II, year 2010). Data for the feasibility study were collected during the training of PNs, working in HC, in the use of the DRP-RAT (Study III, year 2011). The PN-conducted (n=25) DRP risk assessments by DRP-RAT (n=85) and the same clients  copied medication lists (n=68), face-to-face discussions and responses to open questions of the returned feedback forms (n=23) were analyzed. In 2013, an experienced geriatrician reviewed HC clients  (n=45) medications by using three different reviewing methods on each patient (Study IV). The methods based on: 1) DRP-RAT (n=45) completed by the PNs (n=26) and copied medication lists; 2) health centre s medical records ( gold standard ); and 3) Methods 1 and 2 together. Results of the reviews and contents of the geriatrician s open comments regarding the PNs¼ risk assessments were analyzed. DRPs in the study population identified and reported by the geriatrician were studied from the geriatrician s DRP classifications (n=45) and by a retrospective review of the geriatrician s case reports (n=45).   The final DRP-RAT consists of 18 items that assess risks for DRPs in home-dwelling clients. It is divided into four sections: 1) Basic Client Data, 2) Potential Risks for DRPs in Medication Use, 3) Characteristics of the Client¼s Care and Adherence and, 4) Recommendations for Actions to Resolve DRPs. The DRP-RAT turned out to be feasible among PNs and the PN-completed tool was capable of providing reliable and timely patient information to support physician s clinical decision making. Compared to the  gold standard  (Method 2), Method 1 resulted in a false negative rating in 7% (95 % CI 1.4 18.3) of the cases (3/45). The geriatrician identified an average of 3.1 potential DRPs per patient.   This study indicates that the DRP-RAT, developed and validated in this study, could make it possible to more effectively involve PNs, working in HC, in medication risk management among the home-dwelling aged, and that medication risk management should be focused on the highest priority risks. Actions to facilitate the implementation of the DRP-RAT in the Finnish health care system are needed. Future studies are needed to evaluate the effects of PNs¼ risk assessments using the DRP-RAT on clinical, humanistic and economic outcomes." nohref="" />

The universe is populated with magnetically active stars. This magnetic activity is thought to be generated by dynamos operating in turbulent stellar convection zones, a process by which kinetic energy is converted into magnetic energy. The solar dynamo is but one dynamo type possible for stars. Rapidly rotating late-type stars are observed to have large spots, activity cycles, flip-flops, and active longitudes, all indicating a different dynamo mechanism may be responsible. Numerical simulations provide a tool for better understanding some of the mechanisms responsible for these dynamos.   In this thesis, direct numerical simulations in spherical wedges are used to study dynamo mechanisms in the stellar convection zone. These spherical wedges are used to investigate the dependence of the resulting magnetic field on input parameters such as the density stratification and rotation rate. Mean-field models are used to evaluate the assumption that the wedges can be used to approximate full spheres.   As rotation increases, differential rotation decreases in the models, in agreement with observations where more rapidly rotating stars have smaller estimates for differential rotation. As density stratification approaches more realistic values, a lat- itudinal dynamo wave with equatorward propagation is found. The impact of the domain size in the azimuthal direction on the results is explored. When the domain size is increased to 2pi in the azimuthal direction, a non-axisymmetric m = 1 mode is excited. This non-axisymmetry is reminiscent of the field configurations of rapidly rotating late-type stars. The azimuthal dynamo wave rotates nearly independently of latitude and depth, and its rotation rate is slower than that of the mean rotation of the model. This azimuthal dynamo can provide a possible explanation for the observed rotational difference of spots from the mean rotation observed on stars.   The wedges use the perfect conductor boundary conditions at the latitudinal boundary to compensate for the omission of polar regions due to the time step becoming prohibitively small there. Simple mean-field models with only a latitudinal extent and perfectly conducting boundaries do not oscillate when the model is extended to the poles. Thus oscillations near the polar region may be an artifact of the boundary condition. However, when the alpha effect from mean-field dynamo theory and magnetic diffusivity are concentrated towards lower latitudes, oscillatory solutions with equatorward migration are found. When sufficient shear is added, oscillatory solutions are again found, and the Parker-Yoshimura rule for latitudinal dynamo wave propagation is obeyed. It is concluded that numerical simulations where the alpha effect and diffusivity are found to be stronger at lower latitudes and simulations with sufficient shear are considered good approximations of full spheres.   These numerical simulations are put into context with stellar observations. Two young solar analogs are selected, V352 Canis Majoris and LQ Hydrae. V352 CMa is considered an active star, while LQ Hya is classified as a super-active star. The continuous period search method is applied to the low-amplitude light curves of V352 CMa. Stable active longitudes with rotation periods of 7.157 days are found. This is faster than the mean rotation of 7.24 days. Such active longitudes may be due to the underlying magnetic structure with azimuthal dynamo waves competing with differential rotation.   LQ Hya rotates even more rapidly with a rotation period of only 1.600 days. A carrier period is selected of 1.605 days using the D2 statistical analysis. Primary and secondary light curve minima are found with the carrier fit analysis. No stable active longitudes are found, instead, there is only a short period spanning a few years where an active longitude may exist, but the rotation period is poorly defined. Several possible flip-flop events are identified. The azimuthal dynamo waves in numerical simulations with comparable rotation rates have a similar chaotic nature.   The Doppler Imaging technique is applied to LQ Hya to examine the latitudinal spot structure. Spots at high and low latitudes are in agreement with the bimodal structure of the D2 statistic used in the carrier fit analysis. Temperature maps of LQ Hya spanning four years show an increase and a decrease in spot coverage, but no cycle can be found. Because LQ Hya is a rapidly rotating star, differential rotation is estimated to be very small. The azimuthal dynamo wave presents a new possible explanation for the jumps and trends of the spots in observations of this star." nohref="" />

Human-caused habitat changes have led to declines of many species by impairing their occurrence, reproduction and interactions with other species. In Northern Europe, intensive forestry has transformed boreal forests and worsened conditions of species dependent on old forest, but the mechanisms by which habitat changes affect species are often unknown.   In my dissertation, I examined habitat changes, their effects and habitat-associated breeding performances of three declining forest-dwelling hawks, the northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), the common buzzard (Buteo buteo) and the honey buzzard (Pernis apivorus). These species can compete for nest sites and goshawks can also predate the buzzards. Raptors may lack nest sites in managed forests which is why their nesting has been supported by constructing artificial nests. I analysed the breeding success of the hawks in artificial nests since their benefits as a conservation measure were not previously analysed. Finally, I studied the conditions when dominant species can exclude subordinate ones in competition for suitable nest sites.   According to my results, old forests have decreased and young forests increased throughout southern Finland. These changes are adverse for the goshawk whose breeding success improves when old spruce forests are more abundant and young forests scarce around their nests. Breeding performances of the common buzzard and honey buzzard were not significantly associated with habitats. However, common buzzards were reluctant to re-occupy nests surrounded by a vastness of old forest.   The breeding success of the goshawk and common buzzard was lower in artificial nests than in natural ones. Thus, this measure aimed at enabling hawk breeding in managed forests seems to conflict with its conservation objectives. I discuss the possible contributing factors and directions for further investigations.   Interspecific interactions with other raptors proved to be important when a subordinate hawk decided on territory occupancy. Common buzzards prefer to occupy safe territories, where threats of goshawk predation and interference competition with other raptors are small. Thus, interspecific raptors that are predators or competitors may exclude subordinate raptors from their territories, and thereby contribute to their occurrence. Adverse interactions with other raptors may even impede a subordinate raptor from fully exploiting the periodic food peaks.   My dissertation shows that for each species, it is crucial to identify the most relevant spatiotemporal scales in order to identify, how external disturbances affect them most. Long-term data is of paramount importance to detect these scales." nohref="" />

Environmental opportunist pathogens are a class of organisms that are able to both infect multicellular hosts and grow in the outside-host environment as free-living organisms. Environmental opportunism differs from obligate parasitism in that direct host-to-host contact is not necessary for disease transmission and that there are environmental pathogen reservoirs which in suitable conditions act as sources of infection. Because of this, environmental opportunist pathogens form a persistent threat to human health, livestock, and wildlife, and cannot be eradicated by treating hosts. Three well-known examples of pathogens of this class are Vibrio cholerae, Flavobacterium columnare, and Bacillus anthracis, all of which cause sporadic outbreaks. Between infections, these pathogens are subject to multiple biotic and abiotic environmental pressures in the outside-host environment. While environmental opportunist pathogens are not dependent on live hosts for transmission and thus benefit from increased virulence, balancing between the two environments, within-host and outside-host, might incur trade-offs and thus limitations to their spread. In this thesis I have developed mathematical models of environmental opportunist pathogen dynamics and studied the effects of environmental variation and outsidehost interactions on patterns of pathogen outbreaks. The studies included in the thesis address (i) the origin of a sigmoidal dose-dependent infectivity response, (ii) the effect of competition in the outside-host environment on opportunist pathogen outbreaks, (iii) the effect of environmental variation on environmental opportunist dynamics, and (iiii) how environmental variation enables invasions of emerging opportunist pathogen strains. The modelling approach has enabled identification of factors such as alleviation of competitive pressure and certain kinds of environmental variation as outside-host environmental factors that promote outbreaks. Additionally, modelling results can be used to suggest control strategies to reduce the probability of environmental opportunist pathogen outbreaks." nohref="" />

The localized, crustal magnetic fields on the Moon show complex interactions with the impinging solar wind. Understanding these interactions aid in characterizing the lunar plasma and dust environment, in developing advanced remote imaging techniques for airless bodies such as the Moon and Mercury, and in comprehending the basic plasma processes of plasma environments and phenomena on the Hall physics scale.  In this work a lunar magnetic anomaly is modeled in the mesoscale of hundreds of kilometers with 100~nT surface field anomaly. A numerical hybrid plasma model is employed, in which ions are treated as fully kinetic macroparticles, with electrons providing a massless, charge-neutralizing fluid. The effects of electron currents in these environments are discussed, and results of the effect of the interplanetary magnetic field conditions on the minimagnetosphere are presented in three cases: Open, closed, nominal. Results for three different impinging solar wind velocities in the nominal case are presented. The results are compared with satellite observations and are found to reproduce observations of proton deceleration and reflection by anti-moonward electric field. The model is shown to reproduce observed ENA emission from the lunar surface, with predictions on solar wind-depentant features.  Model development by the author is presented with regards to the convergence and stability of the numerical scheme, especially in terms of dealing with a fast whistler mode. Considerations on the validity of the results are presented, with the conclusion of reasonable confidence in the results, with suggested improvements to the model brought forwards." nohref="" />

Parasite community dynamics is one of the central themes in contemporary parasitology. While between-host dynamics has been studied for a long time, within-host dynamics is less well studied. My aim was to identify which factors affect the parasite community during the lifetime of individual hosts by following longitudinally several individuals from a long-living species. Specifically, I was interested in how the dynamics of infra- and component communities differ from one another and which traits explain the variation in infracommunities.   I studied rufous mouse lemur (Microcebus rufus), which is a primate living in the eastern montane rainforests of Madagascar. Mouse lemur is a well-suited study species as it can live for up to ten years in the wild. Due to its small size, the population density is high and trapping straightforward. Nematodes are the most common helminths found in mouse lemurs, but their identification is difficult. Typically, the nematodes are identified from adult specimens, but for longitudinal studies, this is not possible, as we cannot dissect the host individuals. In addition, morphological differences between species are small and we expected to encounter previously undescribed species. These difficulties led to the development of a new method, based on metabarcoding, to identify parasitic nematodes from fecal samples. The method I developed encompasses all steps from fieldwork to sequence analysis.   Despite numerous confounding factors, the method managed to amplify and analyze half of the samples collected. Whilst there is room for further improvements, the main advantage is that the method works well for different host species, for example mouse lemurs and gastropods. In principle, this method works for all species of nematode, including free-living soil nematodes. Nevertheless, the resolution of identification do not allow for species-level identification.   The variation in the parasite community inside individual hosts was extensive, but at the population level remained stable. Most of the parasites belonged to the putative species thought to be Strongyloides sp. The reason for this species success might be its lifecycle, the parasite can live in the intestine or as a free-living form in the soil.   Due to the limited number of samples, the factors affecting the dynamics in individual mouse lemurs are difficult to analyze. It appears that sex and age do not have an effect on either parasite load or variation in parasite dynamics. Nevertheless, body condition appears to bear a consequence with the individuals in better condition having more parasite species in addition to higher fecal egg loads. The reason may be that those individuals are able to sustain larger populations of parasites, or that they are more tolerant to parasites. Hibernation could lead to the extinction of the nematode community, whereas higher precipitation appeared to lead to higher prevalences. This work gives insights into the dynamics of parasite communities both at the host individual and population level. It highlights the need for longitudinal studies as parasite community dynamics in host individual-level cannot be inferred from the host population-level The method I have developed can be used to perform more efficient and faster surveys of previously unknown parasite communities, though further development is necessary for better reliability." nohref="" />

Ahonen, Teppo

Measuring similarity in music data is a problem with various potential applications. In recent years, the task known as cover song identification has gained widespread attention. In cover song identification, the purpose is to determine whether a piece of music is a different rendition of a previous version of the composition. The task is quite trivial for a human listener, but highly challenging for a computer.   This research approaches the problem from an information theoretic starting point. Assuming that cover versions share musical information with the original performance, we strive to measure the degree of this common information as the amount of computational resources needed to turn one version into another. Using a similarity measure known as normalized compression distance, we approximate the non-computable Kolmogorov complexity as the length of an object when compressed using a real-world data compression algorithm. If two pieces of music share musical information, we should be able to compress one using a model learned from the other.   In order to use compression-based similarity measuring, the meaningful musical information needs to be extracted from the raw audio signal data. The most commonly used representation for this task is known as chromagram: a sequence of real-valued vectors describing the temporal tonal content of the piece of music. Measuring the similarity between two chromagrams effectively with a data compression algorithm requires further processing to extract relevant features and find a more suitable discrete representation for them. Here, the challenge is to process the data without losing the distinguishing characteristics of the music.   In this research, we study the difficult nature of cover song identification and search for an effective compression-based system for the task. Harmonic and melodic features, different representations for them, commonly used data compression algorithms, and several other variables of the problem are addressed thoroughly. The research seeks to shed light on how different choices in the scheme attribute to the performance of the system. Additional attention is paid to combining different features, with several combination strategies studied. Extensive empirical evaluation of the identification system has been performed, using large sets of real-world music data.   Evaluations show that the compression-based similarity measuring performs relatively well but fails to achieve the accuracy of the existing solution that measures similarity by using common subsequences. The best compression-based results are obtained by a combination of distances based on two harmonic representations obtained from chromagrams using hidden Markov model chord estimation, and an octave-folded version of the extracted salient melody representation. The most distinct reason for the shortcoming of the compression performance is the scarce amount of data available for a single piece of music. This was partially overcome by internal data duplication. As a whole, the process is solid and provides a practical foundation for an information theoretic approach for cover song identification." nohref="" />
